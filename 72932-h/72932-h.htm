<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>Nothing is more natural than the circumstance that war
should be the outcome of the existing crisis; yet, equally,
nothing is less certain. If the area of hostilities were not
confined to the Far East, and the Power confronting
Japan were any other than Russia, the outbreak of war
might be predicted positively. But with Russia, consideration
of the strategic qualities of her position in Manchuria
must exercise a paramount influence upon her movements.
To those who are not close students of military history,
as well as to those who do not possess an extensive
knowledge of the situation, the position in which Russia
is placed equally affords the keenest interest. Certainly
in the annals of military history, excluding the march of
Napoleon upon Moscow, there is no war which may be said
to have developed a parallel to the task which besets Russia
in Manchuria and Korea. Her position at sea, moreover, is
no better than that which she holds on land. Upon land,
a single line of railway traversing the heart of an enemy’s
country terminates at Port Arthur. At sea, Vladivostock is
cut off by reason of its position, while it is inaccessible on
account of its climate. These points, Port Arthur and
Vladivostock, define the extremities of the strategic position
which Russia holds in Manchuria. Excluding Vladivostock<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
at this moment from any especial consideration, Port Arthur
is left for the opening moves of this campaign. Therefore,
Port Arthur, with a single line of communications in its
rear, becomes the pivot of the operations.</p>

<p>The aspect of Port Arthur from the sea is uninviting.
Rugged hills, offshoots from the range of mountains which
divides the Liao-tung peninsula, cluster round the bay, and
encroaching upon the foreshore and bearing neither trees
nor vegetation, impart to the surroundings a desolate and
even wild appearance. Within the headlands of the harbour,
conforming with the indentations of the coast, there are
several bays shallow and unprofitable, but which in time
may become an important adjunct to the small area of deep
water which the harbour now possesses. Dredging operations
have been undertaken, but there is so much to be done
that many years must pass before Port Arthur receives any
material addition to its very restricted accommodation. The
mud, brought down by the streams which empty into the
harbour, has already affected the deep-water area, and since
the harbour was constructed these deposits have encroached
very considerably upon the depth off shore. At low water
steamers, which lie up within sixty feet of the wharf, rest
upon mud in little more than a fathom of water, and at the
same time the space is so small that it is impossible for a
dozen vessels to anchor in the harbour with any comfort.
Steamers, if any larger in size than the small coasting-boats
which call at Port Arthur from China and Japan must
anchor off the entrance, unloading and re-charging from
junks or tenders. In relation to the requirements of the
squadron Port Arthur is not nearly large enough. When
cruisers are taking in stores battleships remain outside, an
arrangement which is manifestly inconvenient in a period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
of emergency. It was for this reason that the authorities
constructed at Dalny—a few miles from the fortress and
within Pa-tien-wan Bay—a new town, together with
commercial docks and wharves, in order that Port Arthur
might be devoted more particularly to the needs of the
navy.</p>

<p>Port Arthur is happy in the possession of all those
objects which, to a naval base, are component parts of its
success. The dry dock, somewhat weak and unsubstantial,
is 385 feet in length, 34 feet in depth, and 80 feet broad, while
the naval basin is equal in surface space to the total available
steamer anchorage in the harbour proper. When the dredging
works in the harbour bays have been completed it is hoped
that a mean depth of four fathoms will have been obtained.
This systematic deepening of the harbour will give to the
fleet a surface anchorage considerably in excess of one
square mile, but until the work has been executed the value
of Port Arthur as a satisfactory naval base is infinitely
less than the prestige which it enjoys as an impregnable
position.</p>

<p>Port Arthur possesses a small parade-ground, rifle-range,
and artillery practice-ground, torpedo-station and training
reservation, which will be enlarged when the bays are
opened out. There is a flash-light station and various
schools of instruction—torpedo, gunnery, telegraphy—while
the arsenals and workshops which are built around
the naval basin and within the navy yards are very
thoroughly equipped. These effects, however, were mainly
taken over by Russia when she seized Port Arthur; their
existence at the present moment tends to show how impossible
it is to under-estimate the advantages which Russia
derives from the possession of this port, and how far-reaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
are the consequences of the monstrous blunder
which Lord Salisbury committed when he acquiesced in its
usurpation.</p>

<p>Apart from the defences Russia, hitherto, has not added
much to Port Arthur; for the main part the troops have
been quartered in the old Chinese houses or in the former
barracks of the Chinese troops, affairs having been somewhat
neglected in view of the prior claim which the
defences held. Now, however, fine barracks are in course
of construction, and, if there is no war, it is anticipated
that ample accommodation will be ready soon upon the
shores of some of the bays and on the hills. The defences
are indeed magnificent. Very few of the forts, which
were in existence during the time of the Chinese, remain.
Since the Russian Government entered upon possession
the work of extending the perimeter of the defences,
as well as strengthening the fortifications, has been a
continuous labour. It is quite clear that the authorities
are determined upon no half-measures. They
have gained Port Arthur, and they propose to keep it.
Upon the cliffs, rising immediately from the right of the
harbour entrance, there is a most powerful position, formed,
I believe, of a battery of six 21-inch Krupp guns, which was
further supported by a fort placed a few feet above the
harbour, and sweeping its immediate front, containing
eight 10-inch Krupps. At the corresponding elevations
upon the opposite headland there were two similar forts
with identical batteries, while the mine fields within the
harbour are controlled from these two lower positions.
Following the hills to the south and north there are other
forts; one in particular, of great size, is placed upon the
extreme crest of the range, and, towering above all else,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
sweeps the sea and approaches to the harbour for great
distances. It is impossible to detect the character of these
guns, but from their position, and the extent of the fort and
the nature of the part which they are intended to fill, it is
improbable that they can be less than 27-ton guns, discharging
shells of about 500 lb. The interior line of forts
is no less formidable, and it must seem that Port Arthur
can never be reduced by bombardment alone, while any
force attacking by land would be severely handled by the
positions from which the Russians propose to defend their
flanks and the neck. At the present, however, there is a
paucity of field-guns among the troops in garrison, in
addition to which many of the more recently constructed
forts lack artillery; while the opinion may be hazarded
that the entire position has been so over-fortified as to
become a source of eventual weakness in the ultimate
disposition of the Russian force.</p>

<p>Of course a fight for the command of the sea must
precede any land operations. Japan is within fifteen hours
steam of Fusan, already a Japanese garrison-town, and of
Ma-san-po, the port to which Russia and Japan make equal
claim. The strait separating Japan from Korea is 200
miles broad, while Russia’s nearest base at Port Arthur is
900 miles away on one hand and Vladivostock is 1200 miles
away on the other. It follows therefore, that in Korea, and
not in Manchuria, the troops of the Japanese army would be
landed. Once established in Korea, Japan would be able to
dispute the supremacy of the sea on equal terms. In this
respect the possession by the Japanese of numerous torpedo
craft confers a distinct advantage upon them, since it will be
within their power to utilise their services if the Russian
fleet were to attempt to check the movement. The absence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span>
of any facilities for repairing damages makes it certain that
so far as possible the Russian fleet will evade any serious
engagement. It would be difficult to improve upon the
position of Japan in this respect. At Yokosuka, from which
place a large number of cruisers have been launched, there
is a very extensive building-yard, and Japan also possesses
suitable docks for large ships at Kure and Nagasaki. In all
she has at her immediate disposal some half a dozen docks,
400 ft. in length or more, and a very skilful army of
working mechanics and workmen in general. Port Arthur
must be regarded for practical purposes the naval base
of Russia in the Far East in the event of a cold-weather
campaign.</p>

<p>Vladivostock is too far removed from the range of probable
utility. At this port, however, Russia has constructed
one large dry dock, one floating dock 301 ft. long, and a second
dry dock has been laid down. Against these two solitary
and isolated centres, Japan possesses naval bases, arsenals
and docks at the following points on her coast.</p>

<p>The squadrons which Japan and Russia will be able to
employ in this war are very formidable, and during the past
few months each Power has made strenuous efforts to
increase the strength of its fleet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiii"></a>[xxiii]</span></p>

<p>In January 1903 the aggregate tonnage of the Russian
Pacific Squadron stood at some 87,000 tons, the fleet
including the battleships <i>Peresviet</i>, <i>Petropavlovsk</i>, <i>Poltava</i>,
<i>Sevastopol</i>, and the cruisers <i>Rossia</i>, <i>Gromoboi</i>, and <i>Rurik</i>,
with other smaller vessels.</p>

<p>In March the tonnage went up to 93,000 tons, thanks to
the arrival of the cruiser <i>Askold</i> from the Baltic.</p>

<p>In May the cruisers <i>Diana</i>, <i>Pallada</i>, <i>Novik</i>, and the
battleship <i>Retvizan</i> joined.</p>

<p>In June the cruisers <i>Bogatyr</i> and <i>Boyarin</i> reached the
scene.</p>

<p>In July the battleship <i>Probleda</i> arrived.</p>

<p>In November the battleship <i>Tzarevitch</i> and the cruiser
<i>Bayan</i> further added to Russia’s strength.</p>

<p>In December the battleship <i>Oslyabya</i>, the armoured
cruiser <i>Dimitri Donskoi</i>, the protected cruisers <i>Aurora</i> and
<i>Almaz</i>, and eleven torpedo-boat destroyers.</p>

<p>In January 1904 the battleship <i>Imperator Alexander III</i>.
leaves the Baltic for the Far East.</p>

<p>Russia has laboured under great disadvantages to secure
her position in this region. In consequence of restricted
shipbuilding resources and owing to an unfortunate geographical
position, Russia has not enjoyed those opportunities
of adding to her Pacific fleet which have presented themselves
to Japan. In effect, if not in fact, Russia is compelled
to maintain four navies. Unhappily, each is isolated from
the other, many hundreds of miles separating them. Naval
squadrons are concentrated in the Baltic, in the Black Sea,
in the Caspian Sea and in the Pacific. The Pacific squadron
is of recent establishment and of most modern construction.
It dates back to 1898, from which time her policy of naval
expansion began. Orders were placed with France,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
Germany and America for cruisers and battleships, coal
was bought at Cardiff, and in a short space the nucleus of a
powerful fleet had sprung into existence. At the present
time these new ships are deficient in the various ratings, and
hundreds of mechanics, gunners and engineers have been
withdrawn from the Black Sea Squadron to do service with
the Pacific Fleet, moving to the Pacific Ocean from the
Black Sea by means of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Just
now, and until the acute phase of the crisis has disappeared
or war has been declared, the disposition of the Russian
Pacific Squadron is as follows.</p>

<p>At Port Arthur, the battleships <i>Petropavlovsk</i>, <i>Poltava</i>,
<i>Sevastopol</i>, <i>Peresviet</i>, <i>Retvizan</i>, <i>Probleda</i>, and <i>Tzarevitch</i>; the
first-class cruisers <i>Bayan</i>, <i>Askold</i>, <i>Pallada</i>, <i>Diana</i>, and
<i>Varyag</i>; the gunboats <i>Bobr</i>, <i>Gremyashtchi</i>, and <i>Koreetz</i>; the
transports <i>Amur</i>, <i>Yenissei</i>, and <i>Angara</i>; the torpedo-cruisers
<i>Vsadnik</i>, and <i>Gaidamak</i>; and the destroyers <i>Bezshumni</i>,
<i>Bezposhadni</i>, <i>Bditelni</i>, <i>Bezstrashni</i>, <i>Boevoi</i>, <i>Vnimatelni</i>, <i>Vnushitelni</i>,
<i>Viposlivi</i>, <i>Vlastni</i>, <i>Burni</i>, and <i>Boiki</i>.</p>

<p>At Vladivostock, the first-class cruisers <i>Rossia</i>, <i>Gromoboi</i>,
<i>Rurik</i>, and <i>Bogatyr</i>, the gunboat <i>Mandchur</i>, and the transport
<i>Lena</i>.</p>

<p>At Chemulpo, the second-class cruiser <i>Boyarin</i>, and the
destroyer <i>Grossovoi</i>.</p>

<p>At Ma-san-po, the second-class cruiser <i>Rasboinik</i>.</p>

<p>In Nimrod Bay, the second-class cruiser <i>Djijdjit</i>.</p>

<p>At Newchwang, the gunboats <i>Otvazhni</i> and <i>Sivutch</i>.</p>

<p>At Nagasaki, the gunboat <i>Gilvak</i>.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this list that Russia practically has
the whole of her Pacific Squadron in and about the Yellow
Sea. In addition to this force there is the squadron now
<i>en suite</i> for the Far East, which lately passed through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
Bizerta. This comprises the battleship <i>Oslyabya</i>, two
second-class cruisers, <i>Aurora</i> and <i>Dimitri Donskoi</i>, and
eleven torpedo-boat destroyers. The added strength which
Russia will receive when these reinforcements, under
Admiral Virenius, reach her will give her a numerical
superiority over Japan. The greater efficiency, and that
higher degree of skill, which is so noticeable aboard the
Japanese fleet, reduces this preponderance to a mean level.
However, Russia is by no means to be caught napping, as
the formation in Port Arthur of a reserve naval brigade
tends to show. Meanwhile, however, the subjoined detailed
list presents the principal vessels in the Russian Pacific
Squadron. The officers commanding are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vice-Admiral Stark,</li>
<li>Rear-Admiral Prince Ukhtomski,</li>
<li>Rear-Admiral Baron Shtakelberg,</li>
<li>Admiral Virenius (to join).</li>

<p>Reinforcements to join: Gremyashtchi, Admiral Nakhimoff; Aurora,
Admiral Korniloff; Otrajny, Dmitri Donskoi; Almaz.</p>

<p>The gunboats on this station number nine, the destroyers
eighteen, and the transports six. Thirteen destroyers are to
join.</p>

<p>This fleet, with reinforcements, compares numerically
with the eventual strength of Japan as follows:</p>

<p>A proportion of Japanese cruisers would be needed for
coast defence, so that Russia is becoming numerically the
stronger for sea work. In addition, Russia also has a powerful
auxiliary fleet, consisting of ten steamers of the Black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
Sea Steam Navigation Company, most of which were built
on the Tyne, and average fourteen knots. The Russian
Volunteer Fleet Association numbers twelve Tyne and
Clyde built ships. They are also at the disposal of the
authorities.</p>

<p>Against this fighting array the Japanese are able to place
vessels of equal size and displacement; in the actual weight
of metal the Japanese are at a disadvantage, but in the
thickness of the armoured protection there is little to choose.
Against this comparative equality of the opposing fleets
there must be borne in mind the great advantage which
Japan derives from her ability to use her own fortified ports
as naval bases. Indeed, this is of such importance that the
knowledge of this fact might induce her to risk her whole
strength in a single engagement. Again, in the mercantile
marine, which has increased enormously of recent years,
Japan will find all she may require for the purposes of transport
and auxiliaries to the war fleet. The principal vessels
in the Japanese navy are here indicated:</p>

<p>In connection with the First Division of the Japanese
Fleet an interesting fact has transpired which, from reason
of its association with this country, will prove of more than
ordinary interest. In case of war it appears that with one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
exception the ships comprising this division are all British
built. Designs, armour-plating and armament follow the
type and standard of our own Navy, and it is therefore
obvious that we cannot fail to be stirred deeply by the results
of any collision which may occur. Each nation possesses
in Far Eastern waters ships supplied with the latest appliances
which science and ingenuity have devised. To the
people of this Empire, whose security rests primarily upon
the Fleet, our interest in the engagements is naturally the
higher, by reason of the similarity between the ships which
will be engaged upon one side and those of our own Navy.
These vessels, all of which have received their war-paint,
and whose place of concentration is Nagasaki, some
585 nautical miles from Port Arthur, are as follows:</p>

<p>The present constitution of the Japanese Army dates from
1873, and the Military Forces consist of—(1) the permanent
or Regular Army, with its Reserves and Recruiting Reserves;
(2) the Territorial Army; (3) the National Militia; and (4)
the Militia of the various island centres off the coast, &amp;c.
Military service is obligatory in the case of every able-bodied
male from the age of seventeen to forty years of age. Of
this period, three years are passed in the permanent or
Regular Army, four years and four months in the Regular
Reserves, five years in the Territorial Army, and the remaining
liability in the National Militia. The permanent Army,
with its Reserves, conducts operations abroad, and the
Territorial Army and the Militia are for home defence.
These latter are equipped with Peabody and Remington
single-loading rifles. The up-to-date strength of the permanent
Army, on a war footing, which does not include the
Reserves, is as follows:</p>

mobilisation, the grand effective strength of the Army available
for service beyond the seas would amount to 7400
officers, 224,990 rank and file, 798 guns, and 67,152 horses.
Behind this, there is the Territorial Army, comprising 386
Infantry battalions, 99 squadrons, 26 Engineer and Transport
companies, and about 70 batteries, or 11,735 officers,
348,100 men, 1116 guns, and 86,460 horses.</p>

<p>The Infantry and Engineers of the Regular Army have
been recently re-armed with the Meidji magazine rifle. The
following particulars show that the Japanese small arm is
a superior weapon to the Russian, which dates from
1891:</p>

<p>The Regular Cavalry have the Meidji carbine. The
Reserves are armed with the Murata magazine rifle, model
1894, calibre .312 in., muzzle velocity 2000 feet-seconds,
sighted up to 2187 yds., and weight with bayonet, 9 lb. 1 oz.
The equipment carried by the Infantry soldier in the field
weighs 43½ lbs.</p>

<p>The Regular Field and Mountain Artillery is armed with
2.95 in. quick-firing equipment, with hydraulic compressor,
throwing a 10 lb. projectile. This is known as the Arisaka
equipment. The Fortress and Siege Artillery have the latest
models of Krupp and Schneider-Canet in siege guns, guns
of position, and mortars. The Reserve Field Artillery are
armed with a 2.95 rifled cannon of bronze on the old
Italian model. The Japanese have no Horse Artillery, and
the only difference between the field and mountain equipments
is that the latter is the shorter and lighter gun, and has
not as long a range. The Cavalry is the least efficient army
of the service. It carries sword and carbine, but no lance.
The horses are badly trained; the men are very indifferent
riders.</p>

<p>The strength of the Russian forces in Manchuria
embraces 88 battalions, 60 squadrons and 50 batteries,
which, together with the garrison forces and fortress
armament, numbers 200,000 men and 300 guns. These
troops in Manchuria are formed into two army corps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span>
of the first line and two of the second. Two new Rifle
Brigades have just been added to the existing strength. They

<p>In the exigencies of active service it happens that the
Russian soldier must forage for himself. Under any circumstances,
however, he sustains himself on very little nourishment,
and relies in a great measure upon what he can find.
The Russian cavalry is armed with sword, rifle and bayonet.
The latter is invariably carried “fixed,” even when the
weapon itself is slung. A few regiments only carry the
lance. The field guns are steel breech-loaders manufactured
at the Obukhov works. They are akin to the Krupp
pattern; many, however, have the interrupted screw breech
piece and the de Bange obturation. At present there are
many varieties of artillery with the Russian troops,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span>
particularly in their fortified positions, to which places the
Russian transported the seizures which they made from the
Chinese during the Boxer crisis. These embraced French,
German and British examples of artillery.</p>

<p>On land, the immense superiority of the reserve numbers
of the Russians reduces the advantages which would accrue
to the Japanese if the fighting were confined to the sea.
At the same time, however, it should be remembered that
the Russian troops are slow movers, and although they
may exhibit magnificent endurance, and although they
may be relied upon to fight well, the lack of individual
initiative upon the part of the Russian officers robs the
operations of that dash and address which is embodied
in the spirit of the Japanese army. Curiously enough,
each side favours the Continental school of infantry and
cavalry tactics, the underlying principles in the training
of the Japanese revealing a close adherence to Teutonic
methods. Neither side will profit, therefore, by any
degree of indivisibility to which they may have attained.
The winter great-coat of either army is very nearly identical
in colour, and for warm weather Japanese and Russians
alike favour a white blouse. There has been talk of the
Japanese adopting a khaki tint; upon the other hand, the
blouse of the Russian soldier is by courtesy equally white or
khaki. In the more important direction of land transport, it
might appear that the Manchurian railway would be a crowning
triumph for the Russian authorities. Unfortunately,
this immense length of rail, badly laid and indifferently
equipped, will impose a perpetual strain upon the military
resources. If the country population could be relied upon
to maintain a benevolent neutrality towards telegraph
poles and lines, railway sleepers and rails, the stone pillar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span>
and balks of the bridges, the possibility of any serious
interruption of traffic would be materially lessened. Unhappily
for the Russians, the attitude and acts of the native
population, who, in a general way, will lose no opportunity
to harass their enemy, must impede the effective co-operation
of the Russian forces.</p>

<p>Against this instinctive feeling of animosity there may
be set the racial sympathy with the Japanese which governs
every Chinaman. In Manchuria particularly, the Japanese
enjoy a high reputation in the minds of the populace,
while there is remembered, above aught else, that prompt
redemption of all obligations during the Chino-Japanese
War which distinguished the policy of the invaders towards
local interests. This policy of benevolence was exhibited
for the second time during the Boxer crisis, and, of course,
the striking example offered by the Japanese, in comparison
with the Russians, was not lost upon the Chinese.
These things are recalled to-day in Manchuria, and they
may be calculated to offset any reactionary sentiment which
may take place in Korea. Between the hospital arrangements
of each belligerent there is little to choose. The
more efficient system of the Japanese service is equalised
by the greater facilities which the possession of railway
communication by the Russians will present to the transportation
of the wounded. It should be pointed out, however,
that the principal medical service—the Russian Red
Cross Society—is wholly patriotic, and that it is not, in any
degree, a military organisation. It is liable to be withdrawn
from the field at any moment after the conclusion of the
major operations.</p>

<p>Beyond these few observations it is difficult—if not
impossible—to trespass with any certainty, although, as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span>
closing remark, it may perhaps be added that, provided the
investment of Port Arthur be satisfactorily accomplished
by sea and that Vladivostock were enclosed by ice, the
estuaries of the Yalu and Lico Rivers enables an admirable
position to be taken up, from which the Russian
position throughout Manchuria may be very readily
threatened. Speculations as to the development of the
campaign upon land are, however, quite absurd until
something is known of the results of the naval engagements
with which the war must open. Meanwhile
the painful familiarity with the costs of war which distinguishes
the British taxpayer has directed no little
attention to the financial position of either country. An
eminent German financier, interested in the public debt of
Russia, lately explained to me that a very large proportion of
the moneys, which have been raised for the construction of
the Russian inter-railway communications in addition to
the Trans-Siberian and Manchurian Railways, has been set
aside from time to time to supplement her war chest. These
sums, added to those collected by Count Mouravieff with
the assent of M. de Witte, and including the large balances
which have accrued to the State by departmental economies
during the past year, represent approximately a capital of
one hundred millions sterling. Against this accumulation
it is said that the financial position of Japan is most
favourable. There is, I believe, a specie reserve in the
Central Bank which amounts to 113,000,000 yen, plus
some 40,000,000 yen in London. Moreover, the bank’s
note-issuing margin is 35,000,000 yen, which will be larger
after the New Year. The Treasury has three capital funds,
amounting together to 50,000,000 yen, besides some millions
in London remaining from the bond sale of 1902. Finally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>
there are large sums lying idle in all the banks throughout
the country, while an Ordinance has been issued which
provides the Government with unlimited credit.</p>

<p>The more recent action of the Russians in Manchuria
tends, of course, to support the view that war may be
imminent. Nevertheless, bluff is a component part of
Russian diplomacy, and there is ground for believing that
the intentions of Russia in the Far East are by no means so
warlike as the preparations now proceeding and the acts
of the Russian administrative officials in Manchuria itself
would imply. Russian diplomacy always covers the
development of its plans by preparing to demonstrate in
a contrary direction; and at the present time her occupation
of Korean territory is little else than the screen, behind
which she proposes to secure her hold upon Manchuria.
Nothing short of war will cause her to retire from her
position in Manchuria; but while Korean territory is of little
value to the Russian protectorate, whatever the compromise
which may be effected between Japan and Russia, she may
be expected to make a determined effort to dominate the
lower waters of the Yalu River. In fact, curious as it may
seem, the estuary of the Yalu River is the very locale of the
dispute between the two Powers, since, if Russia were ever
permitted to dominate the Yalu River, she would gain at
once that special position upon the frontiers of Korea which
it is the desire of Japan to frustrate. In this Japan can rely
only upon the shortshifts of diplomacy; and although the
Russian occupation of Yong-an-po may be circumvented,
the development of An-tung upon the opposite shore of the
river cannot be prevented. It seems, therefore, as inevitable
that some commanding position upon the Yalu River must
ultimately fall to her lot. An-tung lies within Manchurian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span>
territory; the Yalu River is the border stream between
Manchuria and Korea, and at Yong-an-po the nucleus of
an important Russian settlement has been established.
The future contains no promise of the immediate settlement
of the present difficulty. At best the outlook is
confused; while at the same time there is presented in a
manner singularly clear and comprehensible the fact that
Russia neither will evacuate New-chang, be driven out of
Manchuria, nor abandon her position on the Yalu River.
The position of Russia at New-chang has been indicated by
past events, her occupation of Manchuria is an old story,
and she is now engaged in the rapid development of her
interests at An-tung. The position of this port endows it
with unusual advantages, and the commercial potentialities
of the place are very great. It lies about fifteen miles above
Yong-an-po, on the opposite bank. At present the export
trade is confined to millet and silk cocoons, the over-production
of the latter commodity requiring close technical
supervision. Eight miles below An-tung, situated on
the right bank of the river, is the likin station San-tao-lan-tao,
where junks and rafts must report and pay the stipulated
excise before they proceed onward. The river then bears
away to the north-east, and after another stretch of seven
miles there comes An-tung, upon the same bank, at a point
where the stream divides, the eastern branch being the Yalu
River. An-tung is of quite recent construction, and a few
years ago millet fields occupied its site. Under the care of
native merchants large, solid-looking houses have been
built, broad streets have been opened out, and an air of
unusual prosperity distinguishes the place. The anchorage
is thronged with junks, while timber is stacked in vast
quantities below the limits of the town. Sea-going steamers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span>
of the coaster type can here discharge and load their
cargoes, thus obviating transhipment at Ta-tung-kao.</p>

<p>Trade between Ta-tung-kao, which is situated at the
mouth of the Yalu, and Chi-fu, is at present carried on by
small steamers of the <i>Mosquito</i> flotilla and one British ship,
the <i>Hwang-ho</i>, of the China Navigation Company (Messrs.
Butterfield and Swire), while the vast volume of the exports
and imports finds its way hither and thither in Chinese
junks. The run from Chi-fu port is one of a hundred and
eighty-five miles, and the time usually occupied in the trip
north-eastward is twenty-two hours, the steamers anchoring
in the fairway channel at a distance of four miles from
Ta-tung-kao. Ta-tung-kao is a busy town, inasmuch as it
is the place of transhipment for imports and exports, most
of which go to or come from An-tung. The fact of
steamers being unable to approach Ta-tung-kao makes
An-tung the real business centre of the Yalu River. In
respect of An-tung, two hundred Russian cavalry have been
stationed there for over two and a half years. The cantonment
is situated on a small hill, marking the northern limit
of the town, which has no wall. As usual, through the
Yalu Valley these soldiers bear an evil reputation among
the natives, from whom they commandeer at pleasure.
Striking away from An-tung is the Pekin “Great Road,”
which runs to Liao-yang. Above An-tung the river divides
and shoals exist, the water being so shallow that none but
native craft can ply. Wi-ju is situated about ten miles to
the eastward, and at a point west of Mao-kewi-shan, four
miles below An-tung, there is the terminus of the branch
of the Manchurian railway, which is to strike the river.
The construction of this work will begin in the spring of
1904. The first eighty miles offer little obstruction, and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl"></a>[xl]</span>
is intended that the work shall be pushed forward until its
junction with the main line of the system is accomplished.
Russia, therefore, cannot well afford to ignore the consequences
of her policy in the Far East, nor, at the same
time, can she be expected to sacrifice, at the request of
Japan, those great interests which she has been at such
pains to foster. The position is, indeed, a striking example
of the manner in which an imperious policy will create the
taste, if not the necessity, for Imperialism.</p>

<p>The position of Korea in regard to the disputed questions
is a hopeless one. Unfortunately, the government of Korea
is powerless to prevent either the advance of Russia or
the steady spread of Japanese influence. She possesses
neither army nor navy which can be put to any practical
use, and she is in that position in which a country is placed
when unable to raise its voice upon its own behalf. The
army numbers a few thousand men, who, in the last few
years, have been trained to the use of European weapons.
They are armed with the Gras, (obsolete pattern) Murata,
Martini, and a variety of muzzle-loading smooth-bore rifles.
Their shooting powers are most indifferent, and they lack
besides the qualities of courage and discipline. There is no
artillery, and the cavalry arm is confined to a few hundred
men with no knowledge of horse-mastership, and with no
idea of their weapons or their duties. At a moment of
emergency the entire force of mounted and dismounted
men would become utterly demoralised. There are
numerous general officers, while, I believe, the navy is
composed of twenty-three admirals and one iron-built coal
lighter, until quite lately the property of a Japanese steamship
company. Korea is the helpless, hapless sport of Japanese
caprice or Russian lust; and it has been my aim to present an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli"></a>[xli]</span>
impartial study of the condition of the country in the pages of
this volume. Since so many and so much abler pens have
dealt with the position of Manchuria elsewhere, I have confined
myself solely to a review of Korea. For this I trust that
I may not be taken to task, while in order to satisfy those
who think that some reference to the questions of Manchuria
should have been incorporated in my book I have ventured
to impart to my preface the appearance of a chapter which
deals solely with this problem. And now, at the end of my
work, a last, but none the less pleasant, duty awaits me.
In addition to my own notes upon Korea I have gathered
information from many people—writers, travellers, and
students—all interested in the contemporary history of the
Hermit Kingdom. These I now hasten to thank, and by
naming them I would mark my grateful appreciation of
the kindness which they have extended to me. To Mr.
McLeavy Brown, of the Korean Maritime Customs; Mr.
Gubbins, formerly of the British Legation, Seoul; to my
distinguished and learned friend, Professor Homer B.
Hulbert, whose published notes upon Korea have been of
exceptional value, I make hearty acknowledgments; to
Mrs. Bishop, Colonel Younghusband, the Rev. Mr. Griffis,
Major Gould-Adams, authors of interesting and important
contributions to any study of Korea, I express the sense of
my obligation; to the Rev. C. Collyer, who was good
enough to make my spelling of Korean names identical
with the standard of Dr. Gale; to Mr. Bolton, of Messrs.
Stanford, the map makers, of Long Acre, who laboured so
patiently with the many shortcomings of my geographical
data, I am, indeed, indebted. To Sir Douglas Straight, editor
of the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, whose paper it was my delight to represent
throughout my long residence in the Far East; to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii"></a>[xlii]</span>
Nicol Dunn, editor of the <i>Morning Post</i>; to Mr. S. J. Pryor,
of the <i>Daily Express</i>, I have to record my acknowledgment
of the courteous permission of these distinguished people
to reproduce such portions of my work as have appeared in
the columns of their respective organs from time to time.
And last of all to my readers I offer this book in the hope
that an immediate apology for its production may be
permitted to atone for its numerous shortcomings.</p>

<p>Despite the survey work
which has been accomplished
in the past by the Japanese
upon the coasts of Korea,
little knowledge of the
numerous islands and archipelagoes,
shoals and reefs
which make its shores the
terror of all mariners, exists
at present. Until the voyage
of the <i>Alceste</i> and <i>Lyra</i> in
1816, the locality of these
detached groups of rocky
islets was not marked on any of the Japanese or Chinese maps
of the period. In the map of the Empire prepared by the
Jesuits at Pekin in the seventeenth century, the space now
occupied by the Korean Archipelago was covered with the
drawing of an elephant—the conventional sign of ignorance
with the cartographers of that time. In the older native maps,
the mainland embraced groups of islands, the most imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
knowledge of the physical configuration of their own shores
prevailing among the Koreans. In quite recent days, however,
the Korean Government has recognised this fact, and
in the early months of 1903 the Japanese Government was
requested to draw up a complete survey of the Hermit
Kingdom. This work is now in process of execution, the
plan of the coastline already having been completed.</p>

<p>The coast of Korea is remarkable for the number of
spacious harbours which distinguish it. Upon the West
and South, indications of the volcanic period, through
which the country has in part passed, are shown by the
frequency with which these island groups occur. From a
single peak upon one of the small islands off the south-west
coast, as many as one hundred and thirty-five islets may be
counted, stretching to the North and to the South, the resort
of the sea-fowl; desolate and almost uninhabited. Many
of the more important islands have been cultivated, and
give refuge and a lonely home to small communities of
fishing-folk.</p>

<p>Navigation is peculiarly dangerous in these waters.
Many of the islands are submerged by the spring-tides,
and the direction of the channels, scoured by the rush of
the tide, becomes quite indefinite. In the absence of charts
and maps, these island-fringed shores have been the scene
of many shipwrecks; Dutch, American, French, and
British shipping meeting in one grim and silent procession
a common end: captivity on shore or death in the sea.
Some of these unfortunate mariners survived their experiences,
leaving, after the fashion of Hendrik Hamel, the
supercargo of the Dutch frigate <i>Sparwehr</i>, which went
ashore off Quelpart in 1653, records and histories of their
adventures to an incredulous posterity. Most of the islands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
lying off the coast are well wooded. As they are very
beautiful to look upon and very dangerous to approach,
they are regarded with mingled sentiments of reverence and
superstition, differing little, in their expression, from the
fear in which the ancients held the terrors of Scylla and
Charybdis. Their isolated position, moreover, makes them
the centre of much contraband trade between the Chinese
and Koreans; their defenceless state renders them an easy
prey to any pirates who care to ravage them.</p>

<p>The islands off the south-west coast are the sanctuaries
of many animals. Seals sport and play unharmed among
the rocks; the woody peaks are rich in game: teal, crane,
curlew, quail, and innumerable small birds make them their
breeding-grounds. The shores are happy hunting-grounds
for naturalists, and a variety of marine food is found throughout
the archipelago. A number of well-marked species of
sponge may be gathered, and the coral beds display many
violent tints and delicate shades, forming in their beautiful
colourings a sea garden of matchless splendour. The <i>flora</i>
of these islands is a no less brilliant feature of the summer
landscape. Tiger-lilies, showy and gigantic, daisies, asters,
many varieties of cactus, grow side by side with curious
ferns, palms and creepers, almost tropical in their character
and profusion, yet surviving the cooler temperature of
autumn and winter, to greet each coming spring with
freshened beauty. The air vibrates with the singing and
buzzing of insects, the limpid day is bright with gaudy
butterflies. Snow-white herons stand in the shallows.
Cormorants, diving birds and ducks throng the reefs to
rise in clouds with many angry splutterings when their
haunts are invaded. In the deeper waters, there are myriads
of fish; in passing from group to group along the coast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
shoals of whales are to be seen, blowing columns of spray
aloft, of sleeping idly upon the surface.</p>

<p>The coast of Korea is well sprinkled with the names of
foreign navigators, who, in previous centuries, essayed to
visit the Land of the Morning Radiance. With rare exceptions,
these visitors were turned back. Some were
captured and tortured; many were ordered off at once,
few were ever entertained. None were invited to make any
stay in the new land, or permitted to inspect its wonders
and curiosities. Beyond the Japanese, those who succeeded
in sapping the wall of isolation which was so carefully built
around the country and so rigorously maintained, were generally
escorted inland as prisoners, the unconscious victims
of some successful stratagem. In a manner, the fashion
of their treatment is revealed in the curious names with
which these pioneers of navigation have labelled the capes
and promontories, the islands and shoals, which they were
lucky enough to locate and whose dangers they were fortunate
enough to avoid. Many of these names have ceased to
be recognised. The lapse of time has caused them to be
obliterated by European hydrographers from the maps and
charts of the country and seas, in which their originators
had risked so much. In many parts of the coast, however,
particularly upon the west, along the shores of the Chyung-chyöng
Province, these original names have been preserved.
They form, to-day, a tribute to the earnestness and intrepidity
of these early explorers. This mead of recognition is
only just, and is not to be denied to their undoubted gallantry
and enterprise.</p>

<p>It is not impossible to believe that an unusually fickle
fate followed in their footsteps, prompting them to leave
thus for the guidance of future generations, some hint of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
their own miscalculations. If one may judge, from the
brief narratives which these discoverers have left behind
them, the result of their work upon these inhospitable
shores surpassed anything that they had foreseen. The visit
of these hardy spirits aroused the curiosity of the Koreans,
giving to them their first knowledge of that outer world
which they had spurned for centuries. Despite the golden
opportunities now presented to them, however, they continued
to neglect it. The memory of the black ships and
the red beards (Dutchmen)—as they dubbed the strange
craft and stranger devils, that had to appear only off their
shores to be shipwrecked—dwelt long in their minds.
Although they treated these strangers with comparative
generosity, they were careful to preserve inviolate the
secrets and sanctity of their land. They rejected with
contumacy the friendly overtures of strangers who came
in monster ships, and who, forsooth, left behind nothing
but a name. It is scarcely astonishing, therefore, that there
are many points upon the coast of Korea which bear somewhat
uncomplimentary names. Deception Bay, Insult
Island, and False River savour of certain physical discomforts,
which, too great to be borne in silence, left an
indelible impression upon the associations of the spot.</p>

<p>If the Dutch sailors of 1627 were among the earliest to
reach the forbidding shores of this kingdom, the activities of
British voyagers were most prominent in the succeeding
century. The work of Captain W. R. Broughton, of the
British sloop-o’-war, of sixteen guns, <i>Providence</i>, is described
to this day by the bays and harbours into which he penetrated,
and the capes and straits which this gallant man
christened, to the credit of the distant island kingdom from
which he hailed. Broughton in 1797, Maxwell of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
<i>Alceste</i>, with Basil Hall, commander of the British sloop-o’-war,
the <i>Lyra</i>, in 1816, deserve the passing fame which is
secured to them by the waters and capes which have been
named after them. Their names figure as landmarks upon
the west, the east, and the south coasts. While Maxwell and
Hall preferred to devote their attention to the discovery and
examination of the Korean Archipelago—of which, although
Broughton does not mention it, it seems impossible that the
discoverer of Broughton Strait can have been ignorant—Broughton
roughly charted and surveyed the west coasts,
coming to a temporary halt in Broughton Bay, some six
hundred miles to the north. Hall left his name in Basil’s
Bay, where Gutzlaff landed in 1832 to plant potatoes and to
leave seeds and books. A generation later, in 1866, the
archipelago to the north-west was named after the Prince
Imperial, who was to meet his death in Zululand in 1878.
In 1867, Prince Jerome’s Gulf, an inlet upon the mainland
of the Chyung-chyöng Province, was to be the scene of
Oppert’s famous attempt to remove large deposits of buried
treasure and venerated relics from an Imperial tomb. These
names upon the east and west coasts suggest nothing of the
romance which actually surrounds them. At most they
conjure up the shadowy silhouettes of the redoubtable
personages, to whom they once belonged, and with whose
memory many journeys of discovery in these seas are
inseparably linked.</p>

<p>Englishmen were not the sole navigators who were
attracted by the unknown character of the land, and the
surpassing dangers of the waters, around the Island of Quelpart,
where the Sea of Japan mingles in tempestuous chaos
with the Yellow Sea. Russian and French navigators also
worked their way through the dangerous shoals and quicksands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
along the tortuous and muddy rivers, into the harbours
and through the narrow straits which hold back these
islands from the mainland. The shores teem with the
distinguished names of men of science and sons of the high
seas. Following the curl and twist of its configuration a
host of buried names are revealed, the last evidence of men
who are dead and forgotten. It is infinitely pathetic that
even this one last resting-place should be denied to their
reputations. Lazareli, who shares Broughton’s Bay; Unkoffsky,
who foundered in the waters of the bay which is described
by his name; the ill-fated La Pérouse, who, in June 1787,
discovered in the Sea of Japan an island which now bears
the name of the astronomer—Dagelet. Durock, Pellisier,
Schwartz, and the rest—what echo do we find of them,
their fates, and subsequent careers? Should not their
names at least bear witness to their pains and labours, to the
difficulties which they faced, to the small joy of something
attempted, something done, which was their sole consolation
for many hours of cheerless and empty vigil?</p>

<p>Korea is a land of exceptional beauty. The customs, the
literature, and the geographical nomenclature of the kingdom
prove that the superb and inspiring scenery of the peninsula
is quite appreciated by the people. In the same manner that
the coast-line of Korea bears evidence of the adventurous
spirit of many western mariners, the names given to the
mountains and rivers of the country by the inhabitants themselves
reflect the simplicity, the crudity, and the superstition
of their ideas and beliefs. All mountains are personified in
Korea. In the popular belief, they are usually associated
with dragons. Every village offers sacrifices to the mountain-spirits.
Shrines are erected by the wayside and in the
mountain passes that travellers may tender their offerings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
to the spirits and secure their goodwill. The Koreans
believe that the mountains in some way exert a benign and
protecting influence. The capital of Korea possesses its
guardian-mountain. Every town relies upon some preserving
power to maintain its existence. Graves, too, must
have their custodian peaks, or the family will not prosper,
and the impression prevails that people are born in accordance
with the conformation of the hills upon which the
tombs of their ancestors are situated. Rough and rugged
contours make for warriors and militant males. Smooth
surfaces and gentle descents beget scholars; peaks of singular
charm and position are associated with beautiful women.
Like the mountain-ranges, lakes and pools, rivers and streams
exercise geomantic powers, and they are the abodes of presiding
shades, benevolent or pernicious. In lakes, there are
dragons and lesser monsters. In mountain pools, however,
no wraith exists unless some one is drowned in the waters of
the pool. When this fatality occurs, the figure of the dead
haunts the pool until released by the ghost of the next
person who meets with this misfortune. The serpent is
almost synonymous with the dragon. Certain fish become
in time fish-dragons; snakes become elevated to the dignity
and imbued with the ferocity of dragons when they have
spent one thousand years in the captivity of the mountains,
and one thousand years in the water. All these apparitions
may be propitiated with sacrifices and prayers.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus03" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>GUARDIAN OF A GRAVE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the province of Kang-won, through which the ranges
of the Diamond Mountains pass, there are several peaks
symbolical of this belief in the existence of supernatural
monsters. One dizzy height is named the Yellow Dragon,
a second the Flying Phœnix, and a third, the Hidden
Dragon, has reference to a demon who has not yet risen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
from the earth upon his ascent to the clouds. The names
which the Koreans give to their rivers, lakes and villages, as
also to their mountains, bear out their wish to see the
natural beauties of their land associated with its more distinctive
features. This idiosyncrasy, however, would seem
to be exceptionally pronounced in the case of mountains.
The Mountain fronting the Moon, the Mountain facing the
Sun, the Tranquil Sea, the Valley of Cool Shade, and the
Hill of White Clouds emphasise this desire. Again, in Ham-kyöng,
the most northern province in the Empire, the
more conspicuous peaks receive such designations as the
Peak of Continuous Virtue, the Peak of the Thousand
Buddhas, the Lasting Peace, the Sword Mountain, Heaven
Reaching Peak, the Cloud Toucher. It is evident, therefore,
that appreciation of nature, no less than reverence for the
supernatural, underlies the system by which they evolve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
names for the landmarks of their country. The peculiarities
of their land afford great scope for such a practice, and it is
to be admitted that they give ample vent to this peculiar
trait in their imagination.</p>

<p>Korea is now an independent Empire. From very early
times until 1895 the King of Korea was a vassal of China,
but the complete renunciation of the authority of the
Emperor of China was proclaimed in January 1895, by an
Imperial decree. This was the fruit of the Chino-Japanese
war, and it was ratified by China under the seal of the treaty
of peace signed at Shimonosaki in May of the same year.
The monarchy is hereditary, and the present dynasty has
occupied the throne of Korea in continuous entail since
1392. Inhabited by a people whose traditions and history
extend over a period of five thousand years, and subjected
to kaleidoscopic changes whereby smaller tribes were absorbed
by larger, and weaker governments overthrown by
stronger, Korea has gradually evolved one kingdom, which,
embracing all units under her own protection, has presented
to the world through centuries a more or less composite
and stable authority. There can be no doubt that the
whilom vassal of China, in respect of which China and
Japan made war, has taken much greater strides upon the
path of progress than her ancient neighbour and liege lord.
There is no question of the superiority of the conditions
under which the Koreans in Seoul live and those prevailing
in Pekin, when each city is regarded as the capital of its
country—the representative centre in which all that is best
and brightest congregates.</p>

<p>It was in 1876 that Korea made her first modern treaty.
It was not until three years later that any exchange of
envoys took place between the contracting party and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
herself. Despite the treaty, Korea showed no disposition
to profit by the existence of her new relations, until the
opening of Chemulpo to trade in the latter part of 1883
revealed to her the commercial advantages which she was
now in a position to enjoy. All this time China had been
in intercourse with foreigners. Legations had been established
in her capital; consuls were in charge of the open
ports; commercial treaties had been arranged. She was
already old and uncanny in the wisdom which came to her
by this dealing with the people of Western nations. But,
in a spirit of perversity without parallel in constitutional
history, China retired within herself to such a degree that
Japan, within one generation, has advanced to the position
of a Great Power, and even Korea has become, within
twenty years, the superior of her former liege. In less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
than a decade Korea has promoted works of an industrial
or humanitarian character which China, at the present time,
is bitterly and fatally opposing. It is true that the
liberal tendencies of Korea have been stimulated by association
with the Japanese. Without the guiding hand of
that energetic country the position which she would enjoy
to-day is infinitely problematical. The contact has been
wholly beneficial. Its continuation forms the strongest
guarantee of the eventual development of the resources of
the kingdom.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A MOMENT OF LEISURE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Korea is an extremely mountainous
country. Islands, harbours,
and mountains are its most pronounced
natural features, and
nearly the whole of the coast
consists of the slopes of the various
mountain ranges which come
down to the sea. There are many
patches upon the west, where the
approaches are less precipitous
and rugged than upon the east.
The coast seems to follow the contour
of the mountains. It presents, particularly from the
east, that lofty and inaccessible barrier of forest-clad
country, which has won the admiration of all navigators
and struck terror into the hearts of those who have met
with disaster upon its barren and rocky shores. From
Paik-tu-san to Wi-ju there is one mighty and natural
panorama of mountains with snow-clad, cloud-wrapped
summits, and beautiful valleys with rich crops and quaintly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
placed, low-thatched hovels, through which rivers course like
angry silver. Everywhere in the north the mountains predominate;
monstrous in shape and size. They are rich in
minerals; they have become sepulchres for the dead and
mines for the living—for in their keeping lies the wealth of
the ages, coal and iron and gold; upon their summits, resting
beneath the sky or within some nook hewn from their rugged
slopes, are the graves of the dead. Mining and agriculture
are almost the sole natural resources of the kingdom.
There are great possibilities, however, in the awakening
energies and instincts of the people, which may lead
them to create markets of their own by growing more
than suffices for their immediate requirements. As yet,
notwithstanding the improvements which have been inaugurated,
and the industrial schemes, which the government
has introduced, the reform movement lacks cohesion.
Indeed the nation is without ambition. But the prospect is
hopeful. Already something has been accomplished in the
right direction.</p>

<p>At present, however, Korea is in a state of transition.
Everything is undefined and indetermined; the past is in
ruins, the present and the future are in the rough. Reforms
are scarce a decade old, and, while many abuses have been
redressed, the reform movement suffers for lack of support,
comprehension, and toleration. The aspirations of the few
are extending but slowly to the nation. Progress is gradual
and the interval is tedious. The commercial phase of the
movement is full of vitality, and the factories which have
been established show the evolution of enterprise from
aspiration. Foreigners are introducing education, while
the present commercial activities are attributable to their
suggestion and assistance. The small response, which these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
efforts elicit, make the labour of keeping the nation in the
right direction very difficult. The people can scarcely
relapse into the conservatism of ancient days, but they
may collapse altogether, owing to the unfortunate circumstances
which are now making Korea an object of ironical
and interested observation among the Western Powers. She
may be absorbed, annexed, or divided; in endeavouring to
remain independent, she may wreck herself in the general
anarchy that may overtake her. She has given much
promise. She has constituted a Customs service, joined in
the Postal Union and opened her ports. She has admitted
railways and telegraphs, and shown kindness, consideration
and hospitality to every condition of foreigner within her gates.
Her confidence has been that of a child and her faults are
those of the nursery. She is so old and yet so infinitely
young; and, by a curious fatality, she is now face to face
with a situation which again and again has occurred in her
past history.</p>

<p>The introduction of Western inventions to Korea has
gradually eliminated from contemporary Korean life many
customs which, associated with the people and their traditions
from time immemorial, imparted much of the repose
and picturesqueness which have so far distinguished the
little kingdom. Korea, in the twentieth century, bears
ample evidence of the forward movement which is stimulating
its people. Once the least progressive of the countries
of the Far East, she now affords an exception almost as
noticeable as that shown by the prompt assimilation of
Western ideas and methods by Japan. Chemulpo, however,
the centre in which an important foreign settlement and
open port have sprung up, does not suggest in itself the
completeness of the transformation which in a few years has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
taken place in the capital. It is twenty years since Chemulpo
was opened to foreign trade, and to-day it boasts a magnificent
bund, wide streets, imposing shops, and a train service
which connects it with the capital. Its sky is threaded with
a maze of telephone and telegraph wire, there are several
hotels conducted upon Western principles, and there is,
also, an international club.</p>

<p>At the threshold of the new century, the port presents an
interesting study. With the adjoining Ha-do, a hamlet of
military pretensions, it has grown in the twenty years of
its existence from a cluster of fishermen’s huts behind a hill
along the river at Man-sak-dong into a prosperous cosmopolitan
centre of twenty thousand people. Its growth, since
the first treaty was negotiated with the West upon May 22,
1882, by the American Admiral Shufeldt, has been extraordinary.
Its earlier years gave no promise of its rapid and
significant advance. Trade has flourished, and a boom in
the trade of the port has sent up the value of local properties.
There is now danger of a decline in this state of affluence
which may, in view of the chaos and uncertainty of the
future of the kingdom, retard the settlement and disastrously
affect its present prosperity. From small and uncertain
beginnings four well-built, well-lighted settlements have
sprung up, expanding into a general foreign, a Japanese, a
Chinese, and a Korean quarter. The Japanese section is the
best located and the most promising. The interests of this
particular nation are also the most prominent in the export
and import trade of the port, a position which is emphasised
still further by the important nature of its vested interests,
among which the railroad between Seoul, the capital, and
Chemulpo, with the trunk extension to Fusan, is paramount.
The Japanese population increased by nearly five hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>during 1901. It then numbered some four thousand six
hundred, of whom a few hundred were soldiers constituting
a temporary garrison for the settlement. However, since
the modification by the Japanese Government of the emigration
laws with reference to China and Korea, under
which, in the first weeks of 1902, the necessity for travelling
passports was abolished in the case of these two countries,
there has been a great increase in the number of Japanese
residents at the treaty ports. The settlement at Chemulpo
now embraces one thousand two hundred and eighty-two
houses, and possesses a population of five thousand nine
hundred and seventy-three adults. The census of the Chinese
settlement fluctuates with the season; considerable numbers
of farmers cross from Shan-tung to Korea during the summer,
returning to their native land in winter. In the period of
exodus from China, the Chinese population exceeds twelve
hundred. The complete strength of the general foreign
settlement is eighty-six, of which some twenty-nine are
British. The one British firm in Korea is established in
Chemulpo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus07" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus07.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>AT THE WELLS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are many nationalities in Chemulpo, and the small
community, excluding the Japanese and Chinese, is made up
as follows: British, twenty-nine and one firm, the remaining
twenty-eight being attached to the Vice-Consulate, the
Customs, and a missionary society; American, eight and
two firms; French, six and one firm; German, sixteen
and one firm; Italian, seven and one firm; Russian, four
and two firms; Greek, two and one firm; Portuguese seven,
Hungarian five, and Dutch two, the last three possessing
no firms in the port.</p>

<p>If British interests are not materially represented in
Chemulpo, other nationalities are less backward. By means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of the Trans-Siberian Railway, the journey from London to
Chemulpo can now be accomplished within twenty-one days.
When the Seoul-Fusan Railway is finished, communication
between the East and the West will be still further facilitated.
It is intended that less than two days shall suffice for the
connection between Chemulpo and Tokio. Meanwhile the
service of the Chinese Eastern Railway Company’s steamers
between Port Arthur, Dalny and Chemulpo has been
accelerated. In addition, also, imposing new offices have
been erected at the port. It is much to be regretted that
there is no regular service of British steamers to the ports
of Korea. In singular contrast to the apathy of British
steamship companies is the action of the Hamburg-America
Company, which has now arranged for the periodic visits
of its steamers to Chemulpo. From a commercial standpoint
the port has become an important distributing
centre. Foreign trade with the capital and its environs
passes through it, and the administrative officers of the
more important gold-mining concessions, of which there are
now four, American, Japanese, French, and British, have
settled there. A cigarette factory, supported by the Government,
is now in operation in the port. During 1901 ninety-three
men-of-war entered Chemulpo, of which thirty-five
were Japanese, twenty-one English, fifteen Russian, eleven
French, five Austrian, four German, one Italian, and one
American. Of steamers and sailing-vessels there were 1036,
of which 567 were Japanese with 304 steamers, 369 Korean
junks and steamers, twenty-one Russian steamers, eight
American sailing-ships and one American steamer, four
English steamers, three German steamers, sixty-two Chinese
junks, and one Norwegian steamer—forty-seven more men-of-war
and seventy more merchant vessels than in 1900.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
The shipping which entered and cleared at the port during
1900 was 370,416 tons, realising a small increase upon
previous years; of these, 500 steamers with 287,082 tonnage
were Japanese, 261 steamers with 45,516 tons were Korean,
forty-one steamers of 27,999 tons Russian, two steamers of
4416 tons British, four steamers of 2918 tons German. The
complete return of all shipping entered at the open ports of
Korea during the year 1902—the latest under review—is
added as a separate table at the end of this book.</p>

<p>In Chemulpo, as in all the ports of the kingdom which
are open to foreign trade, there is a branch of the Imperial
Korean Maritime Customs, an offshoot of the excellent
service which exists in China under the administration of
Sir Robert Hart. The working of the Korean Customs, for
which Mr. McLeavy Brown is primarily responsible, is
singularly successful, and redounds greatly to the credit of
the comptrolling power. In an epoch characterised by the
extraordinary ineptitude, indifference, and weakness of our
public men, it is much to be deplored that the services
of this distinguished Englishman are not more directly
dedicated to the needs of his country. The careers of these
two admirable officials fill me with mingled regret for the
remoteness of their sphere of action, and high appreciation
of their unremitting zeal—feelings few public servants may
more fitly inspire than these two isolated, hardworking
chiefs of a sister service, whose work, carried on in an
atmosphere of treachery and deceit, too often meets with
the blackest ingratitude.</p>

<p>The advance which the trade of Korea has made is proof
sufficient of its innate possibilities under honest administration.
If the revenues of the Customs are not diverted in
the meantime to less important objects, there is every hope<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
to believe that facilities will be given to its development.
The Emperor has lately sanctioned the grant of one million
yen from the Customs revenue for the provision of aids to
navigation. Thirty-one lighthouses are to be built; the two
earliest being placed upon Roze and Round Islands off the
entrance to the Han river, upon which Chemulpo lies.
When this work is accomplished, the increase of shipping
in the harbour is sure to create some sympathetic development
in the resources of the country.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>CHEMULPO</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The net value for 1901 of the combined export and
import direct foreign trade throughout the kingdom,
exclusive of gold export, was more than twenty-three
million (23,158,419) yen, the value of the gold export
being a little in excess of four million (4,993,351) yen.
The exchange rate of the Japanese yen is roughly two
shillings and a half-penny, which gives the combined values
of the total foreign trade as 2,873,827 pounds sterling. The
trade of Chemulpo during this time was 11,131,060 yen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
being an increase of nearly one million yen upon the trade
returns of the last three years. The exports were gold,
rice, beans, timber and hides; the imports comprised
American and Japanese goods for the most part, and a
small and decreasing trade with England. The total foreign
imports reached a value of 5,573,398 yen, and the total exports
were 4,311,401 yen. The returns for the year following,
1902, were, in brief: exports, £269,747; imports, £814,470.
Foreign interests in the total trade passing through Chemulpo,
in comparison with those since 1891, show a great and steady
advance. The total revenue for 1891 was a little less than
300,000 yen, and in the year 1900 this sum had advanced to
more than 550,000 yen, the increase in the general prosperity
during these years correspondingly affecting the total
revenue of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Compared with 1901 there was a falling-off in the total
trade of the country for the year 1902. In 1902 the entire
foreign trade amounted to £2,745,346 sterling, which was
composed as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Imports.</th>
    <th>Exports.</th>
    <th>Exports<br>of Gold.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>£</th>
    <th>£</th>
    <th>£</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">1,382,351</td>
    <td class="tdr">846,034</td>
    <td class="tdr">516,961</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The balance of trade was against Korea, therefore, to
the extent of only £16,356 sterling, whereas the average
excess of imports over exports for the past five years was
£107,309. Only in 1900 were the exports greater than the
imports. The average of trade for the past five years was
£2,370,075 sterling, a return which in reality credits the
year 1902 with £378,271 more than the average. As a
matter of fact, the month of December 1902 showed a
larger volume of trade and more duty collected at Chemulpo
than ever before. Specifically, in comparison with the previous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
year, the imports of 1902 were less in the amount of
£117,914, while exports had declined £7567. Large stocks
were carried over from 1901, hence some depreciation in
the volume of the trade was inevitable. However, for the
better comprehension of the economic relations of Korea
with the trade of foreign countries, I have collected the
returns of the years, with which I have dealt here, in one
simple table, to which is added a quinquennial average,
covering a period which begins with the year 1898.</p>

<p>The situation in which Seoul lies
is enchanting. High hills and
mountains rise close to the city,
their sides rough, rugged and
bleak, save where black patches of
bushes and trees struggle for existence.
The hollows within this
rampart of hills and beyond the
walls, are fresh and verdant. Small
rice-fields, with clusters of thatched
hovels in their midst, stretch
between the capital and the port
at Chemulpo. The atmosphere is
clear; the air is sweet; the city is neat and orderly. It
is possible, moreover, to live with great comfort in the
three-storied brick structure, which, from a pretty
collection of Korean buildings, nestling beneath the city
wall, has been converted into the Station Hotel.</p>

<p>There is but one wall round Seoul. It is neither so high
nor so massive as the wall of Pekin; yet the situation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the city gains so much in beauty from the enclosing mountains,
that it seems to be much the more picturesque. If the
capital of Korea is more charmingly situated than the capital
of China, the wall of Seoul is reminiscent of the walls of the
Nankow Pass in the superb disdain with which it clings to
the edges of the mountains, climbing the most outlandish
places in the course of its almost purposeless meanderings.
It extends beyond the lofty crests of Peuk-an and across the
splendid and isolated peak of Nam-san, enclosing a forest
in one direction, a vacant and soulless plain in another,
dropping here into a ravine, to emerge again a few hundred
feet higher on the mountain slopes. The wall is in good
preservation. In places it is a rampart of mud faced with
masonry; more generally it is a solid structure of stone,
fourteen miles in circumference, twenty-rive to forty feet in
height, battlemented along its entire length and pierced by
eight arches of stone. The arches serve as gateways; they
are crowned with high tiled towers, the gables of which
curve in the fashion of China.</p>

<p>Within the radius of these stone walls, the city spreads
itself across a plain, or high on the mountain side, within
the snug shelter of some hollow, enjoys a pleasant, cool and
comfortable seclusion. Within its metropolitan area there
are changes of scenery which would delight the most weary
sightseer. Beyond these limits, the appearance and character
of the country is refreshing, and is without that monotonous
dead-level stretch of plain, which, reaching to the walls of
Pekin, detracts so greatly from the position of that capital.
Within this broader vista there are hills and wooded
valleys. Villages rest beneath the grey, cool shadows of the
bush. Upon the hills lie many stately tombs, fringes
of trees shielding them from the rush of the winds. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
are pretty walks or rides in every quarter, and there is no
fear of molestation. Everywhere it is peaceful; foreigners
pass unnoticed by the peasants, who, lazily scratching the
surface of their fields, or ploughing in the water of their rice
plots with stately bulls, occupy their time with gentle
industry. It is more by reason of a bountiful nature that
has endowed their land with fertility, than by careful
management or expenditure of energy that it serves their
purpose.</p>

<p>A few years ago it was thought that the glory of the
ancient city had departed. Indeed, the extreme state of
neglect into which the capital had fallen gave some justification
for this opinion. Now, however, the prospect is
suggestive of prosperity. The old order is giving way to the
new. So quickly has the population learned to appreciate
the results of foreign intercourse that, in a few more years, it
will be difficult to find in Seoul any remaining link with the
capital of yore. The changes have been somewhat radical.
The introduction of telegraphy has made it unnecessary to
signal nightly the safety of the kingdom by beacons from
the crests of the mountains. The gates are no longer closed
at night; no more does the evening bell clang sonorously
throughout the city at sunset, and the runners before the
chairs of the officials have for some time ceased to announce
in strident voices the passing of their masters. Improvements,
which have been wrought also in the conditions of the
city—in its streets and houses, in its sanitary measures and in
its methods of communication—have replaced these ancient
customs. An excellent and rapid train runs from Chemulpo;
electric trams afford quick transit within and beyond the
capital; even electric lights illuminate by night some parts
of the chief city of the Hermit Kingdom. Moreover, an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
aqueduct is mentioned; the police force has been reorganised;
drains have come and evil odours have fled.
The population of the capital for the year 1903 was 194,000
adults. This is a decrease of 2546 upon the year 1902.</p>

<p>The period which has passed since the country was
opened to foreign trade has given the inhabitants time
to become accustomed to the peculiar differences which
distinguish foreigners. It has afforded Koreans countless
opportunities to select for themselves such institutions as
may be calculated to promote their own welfare, and to
provide at the same time compensating advantages for their
departure from tradition. Not only by the construction of
an electric tramway, the provision of long-distance telephones
and telegraphs, the installation of electric light, a general
renovation of its thoroughfares and its buildings, and the improvement
of its system of drainage, does the capital of Korea
give tokens of the spirit which is at work amongst its inhabitants.
Reforms in education have also taken place;
schools and hospitals have been opened; banks, foreign
shops and agencies have sprung up; a factory for the
manufacture of porcelain ware is in operation; and the
number and variety of the religions with which foreign
missionaries are wooing the people are as amazing and complex
as in China. There will be no absence in the future of
those soothing conjectures from which the consolations
of religion may be derived. The conduct of educational
affairs is arranged upon a basis which now gives every facility
for the study of foreign subjects. Special schools for foreign
languages, conducted by the Government under the supervision
of foreign teachers, have been instituted. Indeed,
most striking changes have been made in the curriculum of the
common schools of the city. Mathematics, geography, history,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
besides foreign languages, are all subjects in the courses of these
establishments, and, only lately, a special School of Survey,
under foreign direction, has been opened. The enlightenment,
which is thus spreading throughout the lower classes,
cannot fail to secure some eventual modification of the
views and sentiments by which the upper classes regard
the progress of the country. As a sign of the times, it is
worthy to note that several native newspapers have been
started; while the increase of business has created the
necessity for improved facilities in financial transactions,
a development which has appealed not only to the Dai Ichi
Ginko. The Russo-Chinese Bank is proposing to contend
with this Japanese financial house. The establishment at
Chemulpo of a branch of the Russian Bank is contemplated,
from whence will come an issue of rouble notes to compete
with the various denominations of the Japanese Bank. Moreover,
the Government is preparing to erect a large building
in foreign style in the centre of the city, to be used as the
premises of the Central Bank of Korea. It will be a three-storied
building, and it is intended to establish branches in
all the thirteen provinces of the Empire. Its chief aim is to
facilitate the transfer of Government moneys, the transport
of which has always been a severe tax upon the Government.
It will, however, engage in general banking business,
and for this purpose Yi Yong-ik, the President of the
Central Bank, is preparing at the Government mint one,
five, ten and one hundred dollar bills for issue by it.</p>

<p>Along with these objects, the postal and telegraph
service has received no little attention. Up to the year
1883 Korea was without telegraphic communication. At
that time the Japanese laid a submarine cable from Nagasaki
to the Korean port of Fusan with an intermediate station<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
upon the island of Tsu-shima. A little later, in 1885, China,
taking advantage of her suzerain rights, deputed Mr. J. H.
Muhlensteth, a telegraph engineer who had been in her
service many years and who formerly had been an <i>employé</i>
of the Danish Telegraph System, to construct a land telegraph
line from Chemulpo by way of Seoul and Pyöng-yang
to Wi-ju on the Yalu River opposite the Chinese
frontier post of An-tung, which had connection with the
general system of Chinese telegraphs. This line toward
the north-west was for many years the only means of
telegraphic communication between the capital of Korea
and the outside world. It was worked at the expense and
under the control of the Chinese Government, and it was
not until the time of the Chino-Japanese war, in the course
of which the line was almost entirely destroyed, that it
was reconstructed by the Korean Government.</p>

<p>In 1889 the Korean Government built a line from Seoul to
Fusan. After the Chino-Japanese war, telegraphic communication
was extended from Seoul to Won-san and Mok-po.
During recent years continuous progress has been made
until the total development in the interior has now reached
3500 kilometres, divided into twenty-seven bureaux and
employing 113 men as directors, engineers, secretaries, and
operators, with 303 as students. The Morse system is in
use. The electricity is generated by the use of the Leclanché
batteries. Telegrams may be sent either in the native
Korean script, in Chinese, or in the code used by the
Chinese administration, and in the different foreign languages
authorised by the International Telegraph Agreement.
Horse relays are kept at the different telegraph
centres in the interior to facilitate communication with
points far distant.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Imperial Postal System in
Korea is comparatively recent. For many years, in fact
for many centuries, Korea has possessed no postal service
as we conceive of it. An official courier service was maintained
by the King in order to carry on correspondence
with the different provincial governors. These messengers
travelled by horse relays, which were maintained at various
points in the country. Private correspondence was carried
on through the medium of travellers or pedlars, the sender
having to arrange privately with the carrier in each instance.
In 1877, Japan, who had entered the Postal Union and had
concluded a treaty with Korea, established postal bureaux
at Fusan, Won-san and Chemulpo for the needs of her
nationals, who were already quite numerous in Korea. In
1882 the Customs Administration also established a sort of
postal system between the different open ports and between
Korea and China. But these organisations were limited to
correspondence between open ports, and whoever wished to
send a letter into the interior had to make private arrangements.
In 1884 the Government of Korea made a first
attempt to establish an official postal system which would
be accessible to all.</p>

<p>It was not until 1895, however, after the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
Chino-Japanese war, that the Korean Postal Service was at
last established under the direction of a Japanese. For several
years this service was confined to Korea herself, and did not
undertake any foreign business. In 1897 the Korean Government
determined to join the Postal Union, and to this end
two representatives were sent to the Universal Postal Congress,
held at Washington in May and June of that year.
They signed the international agreement. Finally, in 1898,
the Government secured the services of M. E. Clemencet, a
member of the Postal and Telegraph Bureau of France, as
adviser and instructor to the Postal Bureau, and on January 1,
1900, Korea entered the Postal Union.</p>

<p>The Service comprises, in addition to the central bureau
at Seoul, thirty-seven postal stations, in full operation, and
326 sub-stations open to the exchange of ordinary or
registered correspondence, whether domestic or foreign.
Seven hundred and forty-seven letter boxes have been distributed
throughout postal circuits in charge of these
stations. Only the stations in full operation are carried
on by agents or sub-agents under the control of the
Director-General of Communications to the number of
756, of which 114 are agents and secretaries, and 642 are
couriers, watchmen, &amp;c. The management of secondary
offices is in the hands of local country magistrates under
the control of the Ministry of the Interior, and has no connection
with the Department of Communications except in
so far as the control and management of the postal system is
directly affected. A network of land postal routes, starting
out from Seoul along the seven main highways, is run daily
in both directions by postal couriers. Each of the large
country offices controls a courier service, which, in turn,
connects with the smaller country offices. These secondary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
offices are served three times a week by unmounted postal
couriers, who number in all 472 men. Each man carries on
his back a maximum load of twenty kilogrammes. When
the mail matter exceeds this limit extra men or pack horses
are employed. The courier has to cover daily a minimum
distance of forty kilometres. In central Korea and in the
south and the north-west each route is covered, back and
forth, in five days. In the north and north-east eight days
are required for each round trip.</p>

<p>Besides these land courier services the Postal administration
has employed, since Korea joined the Postal Union,
various maritime services for forwarding mail matter to
the different Korean ports and for the despatch of foreign
mail. The different steamship companies which carry
Korean mail are: The Nippon Yusen Kaisha, whose boats
touch at Kobe, Nagasaki, Fusan, Mok-po (occasionally),
Chemulpo, Chi-fu, Taku, Won-san and Vladivostock. The
Osaka Chosen Kaisha boats, which touch at Fusan, Ma-san-po,
Mok-po, Kun-san, Chemulpo and Chin-am-po. The last port
is closed by ice from December to March. The Chinese
Eastern Railway Company, whose boats ply between Vladivostock
and Shanghai by way of Nagasaki, Chemulpo, Port
Arthur, and Chi-fu, are also utilised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>The man, who did so much to make a success of the
Korean Customs has also effected the wonderful repairs of
the capital. The new Seoul is scarcely seven years old, but
Mr. McLeavy Brown and the Civil Governor, an energetic
Korean official, since transferred, began, and concluded
within four weeks, the labour of cleansing and reconstructing
the slimy and narrow quarters in which so many
people lived. To those, who knew the former state of the
city, the task must have appeared Gargantuan. Nevertheless,
an extraordinary metamorphosis was achieved. Old Seoul,
with its festering alleys, its winter accumulations of every
species of filth, its plastering mud and penetrating foulness,
has almost totally vanished from within the walls of the
capital. The streets are magnificent, spacious, clean, admirably
made and well drained. The narrow, dirty lanes have
been widened; gutters have been covered, and roadways
broadened; until, with its trains, its cars, and its lights, its
miles of telegraph lines, its Railway Station Hotel, brick
houses and glass windows, Seoul is within measurable
distance of becoming the highest, most interesting, and
cleanest city in the East. It is still not one whit Europeanised,
for the picturesqueness of the purely Korean principles
and standards of architecture has been religiously maintained,
and is to be observed in all future improvements.</p>

<p>The shops still cling to the sides of the drains; the
jewellers’ shops hang above one of the main sewers of the
city; the cabinet and table-makers occupy both sides of an
important thoroughfare, their precious furniture half in and
half out of filthy gutters. A Korean cabinet is a thing of
great beauty. It is embossed with brass plates and studded
with brass nails, very massive, well dovetailed, altogether
superior in design and finish. The work of the jewellers
is crude and unattractive, although individual pieces may
reveal some artistic conception. In the main the ornaments
include silver bangles, hairpins and earrings, with
a variety of objects suitable for the decoration of the hair. The
grain merchants and the vegetable dealers conduct their
business in the road. The native merchant loves to encroach
upon the public thoroughfares whenever possible. Once
off the main streets of the city, the side alleys are completely
blocked to traffic because of the predilection of the shopkeepers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
upon either side of the little passages to push their
wares prominently into the roadway. The business of
butchering is in Korea the most degraded of all trades. It
is beyond even the acceptance and recognition of the most
humble orders of the community. The meat shops are
unpleasantly near the main drains.</p>

<p>There are innumerable palaces in the capital, but as
His Majesty very frequently enlarges his properties, there
is the prospect of other buildings being adapted to his
Imperial use. The precincts of the Palace always afford
opportunities for foreigners to become familiar with the
features of the many Ministers of State. In their anxiety
to advise their sovereign, they wrangle among themselves,
or plot and counterplot, and fight for the cards in their
own hands, irrespective of the fate which their jealousies may
bring down upon their country. At all hours processions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
of chairs are seen making for the palace, where, having
deposited their masters, the retinue of retainers and followers
lounge about until the audience is over. Then, with the
same silent dignity, the Ministers are hurried away through
the crowds of curiously hatted and clothed people who
scarcely deign to notice the passing of the august personages.</p>

<p>The officials are elegantly superior in their manner and
appearance. The distinction in the costumes of the
different classes is evinced perhaps by the difference in
their prices. The dress of a noble costs several hundred
dollars. It is made from the finest silk lawn which can be
woven upon the native looms. It is exceedingly costly, of
a very delicate texture, and cream colour. It is ample in its
dimensions and sufficiently enveloping to suggest a bath
gown. It is held in place by two large amber buttons
placed well over upon the right breast. A silken girdle of
mauve cord encircles the body below the arm-pits. The
costume of any one individual may comprise a succession
of these silken coats of cream silk lawn, or white silk lawn,
in spotless condition, with an outer garment of blue silk
lawn. The movement of a number of these people dressed
in similar style is like the rustle of a breeze in a forest of
leaves. The dress of the less exalted is no less striking in
its unblemished purity. It costs but a few dollars. It is
made from grass lawn of varying degrees of texture or of
plain stout calico. It is first washed, then pounded with
heavy sticks upon stones, and, after being dried, beaten
again upon a stock until it has taken a brilliant polish. This
is the sole occupation of the women of the lower classes,
and through many hours of the day and night the regular
and rhythmic beating of these laundry sticks may be heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>The costume of the women is in some respects peculiar
to the capital. The upper garment consists of an apology
for a zouave jacket in white or cream material, which may
be of silk lawn, lawn, or calico. A few inches below this
begins a white petticoat, baggy as a sail, touching the ground
upon all sides, and attached to a broad band. Between the
two there is nothing except the
bare skin, the breasts being fully
exposed. It is not an agreeable
spectacle, as the women seen
abroad are usually aged or infirm.
At all times, as if to emphasise
their fading charms, they
wear the <i>chang-ot</i>, a thin, green,
silk cloak, almost peculiar to the
capital and used by the women
to veil their faces in passing
through the public streets. Upon
the sight of man, they clutch it
beneath the eyes. The neck of the
garment is pulled over the head of the wearer, and the long,
wide sleeves fall from her ears. The effect of the contrast between
the hidden face and the naked breast is exceptionally
ludicrous. When employed correctly only one eye, a suggestion
of the cheek and a glimpse of the temple and forehead
are revealed. It is, however, almost unnecessary, since in the
case of the great majority of the women, their sole charm
is the possible beauty that the <i>chang-ot</i> may conceal. They
wear no other head-covering. For ordinary occasions
they dress their hair quite simply at the nape of the neck,
in a fashion not unlike that which Mrs. Langtry introduced.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus14" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus14.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THEY WEAR THE <i>CHANG-OT</i></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The head-dress of the men shows great variety, much as
their costume possesses a distinctive character. When they
are in mourning, the first stage demands a hat as large as a
diminutive open clothes-basket. It is four feet in circumference
and completely conceals the face, which is hidden
further by a piece of coarse lawn stretched upon two sticks,
and held just below the eyes. In this stage nothing whatever
of the face may be seen. The second stage is denoted
by the removal of the screen. The third period is manifested
through the replacement of the inverted basket by the
customary head-gear, made in straw colour. The ordinary
head-covering takes the shape of the high-crowned hat worn
by Welsh women, with a broad brim, made in black gauze
upon a bamboo frame. It is held in place by a chain
beneath the chin or a string of pieces of bamboo, between
each of which small amber beads are inserted. There are a
variety of indoor and ceremonial caps and bandeaux which
are worn by the upper and middle classes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>The hair is dressed differently by single and married
men. If unmarried, they adopt the queue; when married,
they put up their hair and twist it into a conical mass upon
their heads, keeping it in place by a woven horsehair band,
which completely encircles the forehead and base of the
skull. A few, influenced by Western manners, have cropped
their hair. This is specially noticeable among the soldiers
on duty in the city, while, in compliance with the orders of
the Emperor, all military and civil officials in the capital
have adopted the foreign style. Boys and girls, the queerest
and most dirty little brats, are permitted up to a certain age to
roam about the streets, to play in the gutters, and about the
sewage pits in a state of complete nudity—a form of economy
which is common throughout the Far East. The boys
quickly drift into clothes and occupations of a kind. The
girls of the poorer orders are sold as domestic slaves and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
become attached to the households of the upper classes.
From their subsequent appearance in the street, when
they run beside the chairs of their mistresses, it is quite
evident that they are taught to be clean and even dainty
in their appearance. At this youthful age they are quaint
and healthy looking children. The conditions under which
they live, however, soon produce premature exhaustion.</p>

<p>Despite the introduction of certain reforms, there is
still much of the old world about Seoul, many relics of
the Hermit Kingdom. Women are still most carefully
secluded. The custom, which allows those of the upper
classes to take outdoor exercise only at night, is observed.
Men are, however, no longer excluded from the streets
at such hours. The spectacle of these white spectres
of the night, flitting from point to point, their footsteps
lighted by the rays of the lantern which their girl-slaves
carry before them, is as remarkable as the
appearance of Seoul by daylight, with its moving masses
all garmented in white. A street full of Koreans aptly
suggests, as Mr. Henry Norman, M.P., once wrote, the
orthodox notion of the Resurrection. It cannot be denied
that the appearance of both men and women makes
the capital peculiarly attractive. The men are fine, well-built
and peaceful fellows, dignified in their bearing, polite
and even considerate towards one another. The type
shows unmistakable evidences of descent from the half
savage and nomadic tribes of Mongolia and Northern
Asia and the Caucasian peoples from Western Asia.</p>

<p>These two races, coming from the North in the one case
and drifting up from the South in the other, at the time of
the Ayraan invasion of India, peopled the north and south
of Korea. Finally merging among themselves, they gave to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the world a composite nation, distinct in types, habits, and
speech, and amalgamated only by a rare train of circumstances
over which they could have had no control. It is
by the facial resemblances that the origin of the Koreans
may be traced to a Caucasian race. The speech of the
country, while closely akin to Chinese, reproduces sounds
and many verbal denominations which are found in the
languages of India. Korea has submitted to the influence
of Chinese arts and literature for centuries, but there is
little actual agreement between the legends of the two
countries. The folk-lore of China is in radical disagreement
with the vague and shadowy traditions of the people of
Korea. There is a vast blank in the early history of Korea,
at a period when China is represented by many unimpaired
records. Research can make no advance in face of it;
surmise and logical reflections from extraneous comparisons
alone can supply the requisite data. Posterity is thus presented
with an unrecorded chapter of the world’s history,
which at the best can be only faintly sketched.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Hermit
Kingdom are peculiarly proficient
in the art of doing
nothing gracefully. There is,
therefore, infinite charm and
variety in the daily life of Korea.
The natives take their pleasures
passively, and their constitutional
incapacity makes it appear as if
there were little to do but to
indulge in a gentle stroll in the
brilliant sunshine, or to sit cross-legged
within the shade of their
houses. Inaction becomes them; nothing could be
more unsuited to the character of their peculiar costume
than vigorous movement. The stolid dignity of their
appearance and their stately demeanour adds vastly to the
picturesqueness of the street scenes. The white-coated,
white-trousered, white-socked, slowly striding population
is irresistibly fascinating to the eye. The women are no
less interesting than the men. The unique fashion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
their dress, and its general dissimilarity to any other form
of feminine garb the world has ever known, renders it
sufficiently characteristic of the vagaries of the feminine
mind to be attractive.</p>

<p>Women do not appear very much in the streets during
daylight. The degree of their seclusion depends upon the
position which they fill in society. In a general way the
social barriers which divide everywhere the three classes are
well defined here. The <i>yang-ban</i> or noble is, of course, the
ruling class. The upper-class woman lives rather like a
woman in a zenana; from the age of twelve she is visible
only to the people of her household and to her immediate
relatives. She is married young, and thenceforth her
acquaintances among men are restricted solely to within
the fifth degree of cousinship. She may visit her friends,
being usually carried by four bearers in a screened chair.
She seldom walks, but should she do so her face is invariably
veiled in the folds of a <i>chang-ot</i>. Few restrictions
are imposed upon the women of the middle class as to
their appearance in the streets, nor are they so closely
secluded in the house as their aristocratic sisters; their
faces are, however, veiled. The <i>chang-ot</i> is by no means
so complete a medium of concealment as the veil of
Turkey. Moreover, it is often cast aside in old age. The
dancing-girls, slaves, nuns, and prostitutes, all included in
the lowest class, are forbidden to wear the <i>chang-ot</i>. Women
doctors, too, dispense with it, though only women of the
highest birth are allowed to practise medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>In a general way, the chief occupation of the Korean
woman is motherhood. Much scandal arises if a girl
attains her twentieth year without having married, while
no better excuse exists for divorce than sterility. In
respect of marriage, however, the wife is expected to
supplement the fortune of her husband and to contribute
to the finances of the household. When women
of the upper classes wish to embark in business, certain
careers, other than that of medicine, are open to them.
They may cultivate the silkworm, start an apiary, weave
straw shoes, conduct a wine-shop, or assume the position
of a teacher. They may undertake neither the manufacture
of lace and cloth, nor the sale of fruit and vegetables. A
descent in the social scale increases the number and
variety of the callings which are open to women. Those
of the middle class may engage in all the occupations of
the upper classes, with the exception of medicine and
teaching. They may become concubines, act as cooks,
go out as wet nurses, or fill posts in the palace. They
may keep any description of shop, tavern, or hotel; they
possess certain fishing privileges, which allow them to take
clams, cuttle-fish, and <i>bêches de mer</i>. They may make
every kind of boot and shoe. They may knit fishing-nets,
and fashion tobacco-pouches.</p>

<p>If some little respect be accorded to women of the middle
classes, those of a lower status are held in contempt. Of the
occupations open to women of the middle classes, there are
two in which women of humble origin cannot engage. They
are ineligible for any position in the palace: they may not
manufacture tobacco-pouches. They may become sorceresses,
jugglers, tumblers, contortionists, dancing-girls and
courtesans. There is this wide distinction between the
members of the two oldest professions which the world has
ever known: the dancing-girl usually closes her career by
becoming the concubine of some wealthy noble; the courtesan
does not close her career at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>It is impossible not to admire the activity and energy of
the Korean woman. Despite the contempt with which she
is treated, she is the great economic factor in the household
and in the life of the nation. Force of circumstance has made
her the beast of burden. She works that her superior lord
and master may dwell in idleness, comparative luxury, and
peace. In spite of the depressing and baneful effects of this
absurd dogma of inferiority, and in contradiction of centuries
of theory and philosophy, her diligent integrity is more
evident in the national life than her husband’s industry.
She is exceptionally active, vigorous in character, resourceful
in emergency, superstitious, persevering, indomitable, courageous,
and devoted. Among the middle and lower classes
she is the tailor and the laundress of the nation. She does
the work of a man in the household and of a beast in the
fields; she cooks and sews; she washes and irons; she
organises and carries on a business, or tills and cultivates a
farm. In the face of every adversity, and in those times of
trial and distress, in which her liege and lazy lord utterly
and hopelessly collapses, it is she who holds the wretched,
ramshackle home together. Under the previous dynasty, the
sphere of the women of Korea was less restricted. There
was no law of seclusion; the sex enjoyed greater public
freedom. In its closing decades, however, the tone of society
lowered, and women became the special objects of violence.
Buddhist priests were guilty of widespread debauchery;
conjugal infidelity was a pastime; rape became the fashion.
The present dynasty endeavoured to check these evils by
ordaining and promoting the isolation and greater subjection
of the sex. Vice and immorality had been so long and
so promiscuously practised, however, that already men had
begun to keep their women in seclusion of their own accord.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
If they respected them to some extent, they were wholly
doubtful of one another. Distrust and suspicion were thus
the pre-eminent causes of this immuring of the women, the
system developing of itself, as the male Koreans learnt to
dread the evil propensities of their own sex. It is possible
that the women find, in that protection which is now accorded
them, some little compensation for the drudgery and interminable
hard work that is their portion.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus20" style="max-width: 43.75em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The system of slavery among the Koreans is confined, at
present, to the possession of female slaves. Up to the time
of the great invasion of Korea by the Japanese armies under
Hideyoshi, in 1592, both male and female slaves were permitted.
The loss of men in that war was so great that, upon
its conclusion, a law was promulgated which forbade the
bondage of males. There is, however, the <i>sang-no</i> (slave
boy), who renders certain services only, and receives his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
food and clothes in compensation. The position of the
<i>sang-no</i> is more humble than that filled by the paid servant
and superior to that of the slave proper. He is bound by
no agreement and is free to leave.</p>

<p>The duties of a slave comprise the rough work of the
house. She attends to the washing—an exacting and continuous
labour in a Korean household; carries water from
the well, assists with the cooking, undertakes the marketing
and runs errands. She is not allowed to participate in any
duties of a superior character; her place is in the kitchen or
in the yard, and she cannot become either a lady’s maid
or a favoured servant of any degree. In the fulness of time
she may figure in the funeral procession of her master.</p>

<p>There are four ways by which the Korean woman may
become a slave. She may give herself into slavery, voluntarily,
in exchange for food, clothes and shelter through her
abject poverty. The woman who becomes a slave in this
way cannot buy back her freedom. She has fewer rights
than the slave who is bought or who sells herself. The
daughter of any slave who dies in service continues in
slavery. In the event of the marriage of her mistress such
a slave ranks as a part of the matrimonial <i>dot</i>. A woman
may be reduced to slavery by the treasonable misdemeanours
of a relative. The family of a man convicted of treason
becomes the property of the Government, the women
being allotted to high officials. They are usually liberated.
Again, a woman may submit herself to the approval
of a prospective employer. If she is found satisfactory and
is well recommended, her services may realise between
forty, fifty, or one hundred thousand cash. When payment
has been made, she gives a deed of her own person to her
purchaser, imprinting the outline of her hand upon the
document, in place of a seal, and for the purpose of
supplying easy means of identification. Although this
transaction does not receive the cognisance of the Government,
the contract is binding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp53" id="illus21" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>IN WINTER COSTUME</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>As the law provides that the daughter of a slave must
take the place of her parent, should she die, it is plainly in
the interests of the owner to promote the marriage of his
slaves. Slaves who receive compensation for their services
are entitled to marry whom they please; quarters are provided
for the couple. The master of the house, however,
has no claim upon the services of the husband. The slave
who voluntarily assigns herself to slavery and receives no
price for her services may not marry without consent. In
these cases it is not an unusual custom for her master, in
the course of a few years, to restore her liberty.</p>

<p>Hitherto, the position of the Korean woman has been so
humble that her education has been unnecessary. Save
among those who belong to the less reputable classes, the
literary and artistic faculties are left uncultivated. Among
the courtesans, however, the mental abilities are trained and
developed with a view to making them brilliant and entertaining
companions. The one sign of their profession is
the culture, the charm, and the scope of their attainments.
These “leaves of sunlight,” a feature of public life in Korea,
stand apart in a class of their own. They are called <i>gisaing</i>,
and correspond to the <i>geisha</i> of Japan; the duties, environment,
and mode of existence of the two are almost identical.
Officially, they are attached to a department of Government,
and are controlled by a bureau of their own, in common
with the Court musicians. They are supported from the
national treasury, and they are in evidence at official dinners
and all palace entertainments. They read and recite; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
dance and sing; they become accomplished artists and
musicians. They dress with exceptional taste; they move
with exceeding grace; they are delicate in appearance,
very frail and very human,
very tender, sympathetic,
and imaginative. By their
artistic and intellectual
endowment, the dancing
girls, ironically enough,
are debarred from the
positions for which their
talents so peculiarly fit
them. They may move
through, and as a fact do
live in, the highest society.
They are met at the houses
of the most distinguished;
they may be selected as
the concubines of the Emperor,
become the <i>femmes
d’amour</i> of a prince, the
puppets of the noble. A
man of breeding may not
marry them, however, although they typify everything that is
brightest, liveliest, and most beautiful. Amongst their own
sex, their reputation is in accordance with their standard of
morality, a distinction being made between those whose
careers are embellished with the <i>quasi</i> chastity of a concubine,
and those who are identified with the more pretentious
display of the mere prostitute.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A PALACE CONCUBINE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the hope that their children may achieve that success
which will ensure their support in their old age, parents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
when stricken with poverty, dedicate their daughters to the
career of a <i>gisaing</i>, much as they apprentice their sons to
that of a eunuch. The girls are chosen for the perfect
regularity of their features. Their freedom from blemish,
when first selected, is essential. They are usually pretty,
elegant, and dainty. It is almost certain that they are the
prettiest women in Korea, and, although the order is extensive
and the class is gathered from all over the kingdom, the
most beautiful and accomplished <i>gisaing</i> come from Pyöng-an.
The arts and graces in which they are so carefully
educated, procure their elevation to positions in the households
of their protectors, superior to that which is held by
the legal wife. As a consequence, Korean folk-lore abounds
with stories of the strife and wifely lamentation arising from
the ardent and prolonged devotion of husbands to girls,
whom fate prevents their taking to a closer union. The
women are slight of stature, with diminutive, pretty feet,
and graceful, shapely hands. They are quiet and unassuming
in their manner. Their smile is bright; their
deportment modest, their appearance winsome. They wear
upon state occasions voluminous, silk-gauze skirts of
variegated hues; a diaphanous silken jacket, with long
loose sleeves, extending beyond the hands, protects the
shoulders; jewelled girdles, pressing their naked breasts,
sustain their draperies. An elaborate, heavy and artificial
head-dress of black hair, twisted in plaits and decorated
with many silver ornaments, is worn. The music of the
dance is plaintive and the song of the dancer somewhat
melancholy. Many movements are executed in stockinged
feet; the dances are quite free from indelicacy and suggestiveness.
Indeed, several are curiously pleasing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus23" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>DANCING WOMEN OF THE COURT</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>Upon one occasion, Yi-cha-sun, the brother of the
Emperor, invited me to watch the dress rehearsal of an
approaching Palace festival. Although this exceptional
consideration was shown me unsolicited, I found it quite
impossible to secure permission to photograph the gliding,
graceful figures of the dancers. When my chair deposited
me at the <i>yamen</i> the dance was already in progress. The
chairs of the officials and chattering groups of the servants
of the dancers filled the compound; soldiers of the Imperial
Guard kept watch before the gates. The air was
filled with the tremulous notes of the pipes and viols, whose
plaintive screaming was punctuated with the booming of
drums. Within a building, the walls of which were open
to the air, the rows of dancers were visible as they swayed
slowly and almost imperceptibly with the music.</p>

<p>From the dais where my host was sitting the dance was
radiant with colour. There were eighteen performers,
grouped in three equal divisions, and, as the streaming
sunshine played upon the shimmering surface of their
dresses, the lithe and graceful figures of the dancers floated
in the brilliant reflection of a sea of sparkling light. The
dance was almost without motion, so slowly were its
fantastic figures developed. Never once were their arms
dropped from their horizontal position, nor did the size and
weight of their head-dresses appear to fatigue the little
women. Very slowly, the seated band gave forth the air.
Very slowly, the dancers moved in the open space before us,
their arms upraised, their gauze and silken draperies clustering
round them, their hair piled high, and held in its curious
shape by many jewelled and enamelled pins, which sparkled
in the sunshine. The air was solemn; and, as if the movement
were ceremonial, their voices rose and fell in a lingering
harmony of passionate expression. At times, the three sets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
came together, the hues of the silken skirts blending in one
vivid blaze of barbaric splendour. Then, as another movement
succeeded, the eighteen figures broke apart and, poised
upon their toes, in stately and measured unison circled
round the floor, their arms rising and falling, their bodies
bending and swaying, in dreamy undulation.</p>

<p>The dance epitomised the poetry and grace of human
motion. The dainty attitudes of the performers had a gentle
delicacy which was delightful. The long silken robes revealed
a singular grace of deportment, and one looked upon
dancers who were clothed from head to foot, not naked,
brazen and unashamed, like those of our own burlesque,
with infinite relief and infinite satisfaction. There was
power and purpose in their movements; artistic subtlety in
their poses. Their flowing robes emphasised the simplicity
of their gestures; the pallor of their faces was unconcealed;
their glances were timid; their manner modest. The strange
eerie notes of the curious instruments, the fluctuating
cadence of the song, the gliding motion of the dancers, the
dazzling sheen of the silks, the vivid colours of the skirts,
the flush of flesh beneath the silken shoulder-coats, appealed
to one silently and signally, stirring the emotions with an
enthusiasm which was irrepressible.</p>

<p>The fascinating figures approached softly, smoothly
sliding; and, as they glided slowly forward, the song of the
music welled into passionate lamentation. The character
of the dance changed. No longer advancing, the dancers
moved in time to the beating of the drums; rotating circles
of colour, their arms swaying, their bodies swinging backwards
and forwards, as their retreating footsteps took them
from us. The little figures seemed unconscious of their
art; the musicians ignorant of the qualities of their wailing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Nevertheless, the masterly restraint of the band, the conception,
skill and execution of the dancers, made up a
triumph of technique.</p>

<p>As the dance swept to its climax, nothing so accentuated
the admiration of the audience as their perfect stillness.
From the outer courts came for a brief instant the clatter of
servants and the screams of angry stallions. Threatening
glances quickly hushed the slaves, nothing breaking the
magnetism of the dance for long. The dance ended, it
became the turn of others to rehearse their individual contributions,
while those who were now free sat chatting with
my host, eating sweets, smoking cigarettes, cigars, or
affecting the long native pipe. Many, discarding their head-dresses,
lay upon their sitting mats, their eyes closed in
momentary rest as their servants fanned them. His Highness
apparently appreciated the familiarity with which they
treated him. In the enjoyment and encouragement of their
little jokes he squeezed their cheeks and pinched their arms,
as he sat among them.</p>

</figure>

<p>A study of the morals and personalities
of the Court of Korea
throws no little light upon the
interesting phases of its contemporary
condition, even affording
some explanation of the political
differences and difficulties which,
if now in the past, may be expected
none the less to crop up again.
Since the dastardly murder by the
Japanese of the Queen, who held
the reins of Government with
strong hands, the power of the
Emperor has been controlled by
one or other of the Palace factions.
His Majesty is now almost a cypher
in the management of his Empire.
Nominally, the Emperor of Korea
enjoys the prerogative and independence of an autocrat; in
reality he is in the hands of that party whose intrigues for
the time being may have given them the upper hand. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
is the slave of the superb immoralities of his women. When
he breaks away from their gentle thraldom, in the endeavour
to free himself from their political associations, his exceedingly
able and unscrupulous Minister, Yi Yong-ik, the
chief of the Household
Bureau, rules him with a
rod of iron. It matters not
in what direction the will
of his Majesty should lie,
it is certain to be thwarted
with the connivance of
Palace concubines or by
the direct bribery of Ministers.
If the King dared,
Yi Yong-ik would be degraded
at once. No previous
Minister has proved
so successful, however, in
supplying the Court with
money; and, as the Emperor
dreads an empty treasury,
he maintains him in
his confidence.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp41" id="illus26" style="max-width: 17.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus26.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY THE EMPEROR</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the position of Minister
of Finance and Treasurer
of the Imperial Palace, which he once filled, Yi Yong-ik
opposed foreign supervision of the revenues of the Maritime
Customs. Acting in concert with the Russian and
French Ministers, he was primarily responsible for the most
recent crisis in the affairs of Mr. McLeavy Brown, the Chief
Comptroller and Executive Administrator of the Korean
Maritime Customs. At a time when the Imperial household<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
was in need of money, Yi Yong-ik created the desire for a
loan by withholding the revenue of the Privy Purse from his
master. It was explained to his Majesty that his financial
embarrassments were due to the action of his Chief Commissioner
of Customs in locking up the proceeds of the
Customs. Supported by the influence of the Russian and
French Ministers, Yi Yong-ik suggested that the Customs
revenue should become the security for the loan which was
being pressed upon him by a French syndicate. When
Mr. McLeavy Brown heard of the transaction between the
agent of the syndicate and the Minister of Finance, he at
once repudiated any hypothecation of the revenues of the
Customs for such a purpose. In co-operation with the
French and Russian Ministers, Yi Yong-ik, upon a variety
of pretexts, attempted to bring about the peremptory dismissal
of the Chief Commissioner of the Customs. He
was foiled in this by the unexpected demonstration of a
British Squadron in Chemulpo Harbour, and the attendant
preparation and embarkation of a field force at Wei-hai-wei.
Upon the withdrawal of the guarantee of the Customs
revenue the Franco-Russian scheme collapsed, the agent
of the interested syndicate returning to Europe to complain
of the action of the British Minister and the Chief Commissioner
of Customs.</p>

<p>Yi Yong-ik is an instance, together with that afforded by
Lady Om, of a Korean of most humble birth rising to a
position of great importance in the administration of the
country. A man of low parentage, he attached himself to
the fortunes of Min Yeung-ik, gradually forcing himself
upon the notice of his patron, as also of his sovereign. The
services which Yi Yong-ik rendered to the throne during the
<i>émeute</i> of 1884, when he was a chair coolie in the service of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the late Queen, found responsive echo in the memories of
their Majesties, who procured his preferment. He was
advanced to a position in which his admitted sagacity,
strength of mind, and shrewdness were of material assistance,
continuing to rise until he became Minister of Finance.
He has thus made his own position from very insignificant
beginnings, and, in justice to him, it may be said that he
serves the interests of his Majesty to the best of his ability.
Nevertheless he is in turn feared and detested. Numerous
attempts have been made against him, while, within the last
few months, failing to take his life by poisoned food, some
unknown enemies discharged an infernal machine in the
room at the Seoul Hospital where he was confined during
an attack of sickness. Alternately upon the crest of the
wave or in the backwash of the tide, Yi Yong-ik remains the
most enduring personality in the Court. The Russian influence
is behind him, while the Emperor also is secretly
upon the side of his energetic Minister. At a moment,
recently, when the opposition against him became too
strong, Yi Yong-ik took refuge upon a Russian warship,
which at once carried him to Port Arthur. From this
retreat he negotiated for a safe return with his Majesty,
who at once granted him a strong escort. Yi Yong-ik then
returned and, proceeding at once to the Palace, quickly
reinstated himself in the good graces of his master, thus
again thwarting the plans and secret machinations of his
opponents.</p>

<p>His Majesty the Emperor of Korea was fifty years old in
September 1900, being called to the throne in 1864, when
he was thirteen. He was married at the age of fifteen to the
Princess Min, a lady of birth, of the same age as her husband.
It was she who was wantonly assassinated by the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
in 1895. The son of this union is the Crown Prince. His
Majesty is somewhat short of stature, as compared with the
average height of the Korean. He is only five feet four inches.
His face is pleasant; impassive in repose, brightening with
an engaging smile when in conversation. His voice is soft
and pleasing to the ear; he talks with easy assurance, some
vivacity and nervous energy.</p>

<p>During an audience with a foreigner, the manner of the
Emperor has an air of frankness and singular <i>bonhomie</i>. He
talks with every one, pointing his remarks with graceful
gestures, and interrupting his sentences with melodious and
infectious laughter. The mark of the Emperor’s favour is
the receipt of a fan. When a foreigner is presented to him,
it is customary to find upon the conclusion of the audience
a small parcel awaiting his acceptance, containing a few
paper fans and sometimes a roll of silk. The Emperor
rarely exceeds this limit to his Imperial patronage, for, like
the rest of his people, he cannot afford to be unduly
generous.</p>

<p>The dress of his Majesty upon these occasions is remarkable
for its impressive and Imperial grandeur. A long golden
silk robe of state, embroidered with gold braid, with a girdle
of golden cord, edged with a heavy gold fringe, covers him.
While the magnificence of this attire excites envy in the
heart of any one who sees it, the ease and dignity of his
carriage suggest his complete unconsciousness of the impression
which he is creating in the minds of his guests.</p>

<p>The Emperor is ignorant of Western languages, but he
is an earnest student of those educational works which have
been translated for the purposes of the schools he has established
in his capital. In this way he has become singularly
well informed upon many subjects. He speaks and writes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
Chinese with fluency, and he is a most profound student of the
history of his own people. The method and system of his
rule is based on the thesis of his own personal supervision
of all public business. If there be some little difference
between the Utopia of his intentions and the actual achievement
of his government, it is impossible to deny his assiduity
and perseverance. He is a kind, amiable, and merciful
potentate, desirous of the advancement of his country. He
works at night, continuing the sessions and conferences
with his Ministers until after dawn. He has faults, many,
according to the Western standards by which I have no
intention of judging him. He has also many virtues; and,
he receives, and deserves, the sympathy of all foreigners
in the vast works of reform which he has encouraged in
his dominions.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus27" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus27.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE HALL OF AUDIENCE, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>His Majesty is progressive. In view of the number and
magnitude of the developments which have taken place
under his rule, it is impossible to credit him with any of
those prejudices against Western innovations which have distinguished
the East from time immemorial. There are special
schools in Seoul for teaching English, French, German,
Russian, Chinese and Japanese; there is a School of Law, a
School of Engineering and Science, a School of Medicine, and
a Military Academy. These are but a few minor indications
of the freedom of his rule, the sure sign of a later prosperity.
He is tolerant of missionaries, and he is said to favour their
activities. It is certain that his rule permits great liberty of
action, while it is distinguished by extraordinary immunity
from persecution. His reign is in happy contrast with the
inter-regnum of the Regent, Tai Won Kun, who regarded
priests and converts as a pest, and who eradicated them to
the best of his ability.</p>

<p>As the autocratic monarch of a country, whose oldest
associations are opposed to all external interference, the
attitude of his Majesty has been instinct with the most
humane principles, with great integrity of purpose and
much enlightenment. It cannot be said that his reign has
been a failure, or that it has not tended to the benefit of his
people and his realms. Certain evil practices still exist, but
his faults as an Emperor are, to a great extent, due to the
worthlessness of his officials. Indeed, he frequently receives
the condemnation which should be passed upon the minds
and morals of his Ministers.</p>

<p>Saving Yi Yong-ik, the most important figure in the
Court is the mature and elderly Lady Om, the wife of his
Majesty. In a Court which is abandoned to every phase of
Eastern immorality, it is a little disappointing to find that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
the first lady in the land no longer possesses those charms
of face and figure, which should explain her position. There
is no doubt that the Lady Om is a clever woman. She is
most remarkably astute in her management of the Emperor,
whose profound attachment to her is a curious paradox.
Lady Om is mature, fat, and feebly, if freely, frolicsome.
Her face is pitted with small-pox; her teeth are uneven;
her skin is of a saffron tint. There is some suggestion of a
squint in her dark eyes, a possible reminder of the pest
which afflicts all Koreans. She paints very little and she
eschews garlic. Her domination of the Emperor is
wonderful. Except at rare intervals, and then only when
the assent of Lady Om to the visit of a new beauty has
been given, he has no eye for any other woman. Nevertheless,
the Lady Om has not always been a Palace beauty;
she was not always the shining light of the Imperial harem.
Her <i>amours</i> have made Korean history; only two of her
five children belong to the Emperor; yet one of these may
become the future occupant of his father’s throne.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THEIR IMPERIAL HIGHNESSES THE CROWN PRINCE AND PRINCESS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In her maiden days, she became the mistress of a Chinaman;
tiring of him she passed into the grace and favour of
a Cabinet Minister. He introduced her to the service of the
late Queen, whose acquaintance she made at the house of
her father, a Palace attendant of low degree, with quarters
within the walls. By the time that she became a woman in
the service of her Majesty, the Lady Om had presented a
child to each of her respective partners. As the virtue of
the women in attendance upon the Queen had of necessity
to be assured, her previous admirers kept their counsel for
the safety of their own heads. The Lady Om boasted
abilities which distinguished her among the other maids
in attendance. She sang to perfection, danced with consummate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
grace; painted with no little delicacy and
originality, and could read, write, and speak Chinese and
Korean with agreeable fluency. The Queen took a fancy
to her apparently
innocent, guileless,
and very lovable
attendant. Imitating
the excellent example
of his illustrious
spouse, his
Majesty sealed the
rape of virtue with
a kingly smile. The
Queen grew restless.
Suspicion,
confirmed by appearances,
developed
into certainty,
and the Lady
Om fled from the
Palace to escape
the anger and jealousy
of her late
mistress. The third
child, of whom Lady Om became the mother, was born
beyond the capital, in the place of refuge where the
errant Griselle had taken up her abode. Meanwhile, Lady
Om avoided the parental establishment within the purlieus
of the Palace. Upon the death of her third child
she sought the protection of another high official. With
him she dwelt in safety, peace, and happiness, becoming,
through her strange faculty of presenting each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
admirer with evidences of her innocence, the subject of
some ribald songs. Since her return to Imperial favour,
these verses have been suppressed, and may not be uttered
upon pain of emasculation.</p>

<p>It now seemed as if the Lady Om had settled down, but
the events of 1895, culminating in the foul murder of the
late Queen, prompted her to renew her acquaintance with
the unhappy Emperor. She became a Palace attendant
again, and at once cleverly succeeded in bringing herself
before the Imperial notice. She was sweetly sympathetic
towards his Majesty; her commiseration, her tenderness,
her suppliant air of injured innocence, almost immediately
captivated him. She was raised to the rank of an Imperial
concubine; money was showered upon her, and she
proceeded immediately to exercise an influence over the
Emperor which has never relaxed. She became a power at
Court and once again a mother. Her influence is now
directed towards the definite maintenance of her own interests.
She wishes her son to be the future Emperor;
she is now living in a palace, and, since she is the apple
of his Majesty’s eye, she permits nothing to endanger the
stakes for which she is playing. Recently Kim Yueng-chun,
an official of importance but of precarious position, wishing
to secure himself in the consideration of his sovereign,
introduced a new beauty, whose purity and loveliness were
unquestioned. Lady Om heard of Lady Kang and said
nothing. Within two weeks, however, the Minister was
removed upon some small pretext, and subsequently
tortured, mutilated, and strangled. The Lady Kang found
that if the mills of Lady Om grind slowly, they grind exceedingly
small.</p>

<p>Lady Om is a lover of ancient customs; by ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
customs she made her way; by ancient customs she proposes
to keep it. Her power increases daily, and a stately
edifice has been erected in the centre of the capital to
commemorate her virtues. A few months before her
marriage to the Emperor, when there was ample indication
of the trend of events, the Emperor published
a decree which declared that Lady Om had become an
Imperial concubine of the First Class. This did not give
her Imperial status; but it conferred upon her son Imperial
rank. By reason of this decree, however, he will, at some
future date, ascend the throne, while it opened a way for
Lady Om to secure recognition in Korea as the lawful
spouse of her royal admirer.</p>

<p>The passing of the Emperor—An Imperial pageant</p>

</div>

<p>The Emperor passed one morning in procession from the
Imperial Palace, which adjoins the British Legation upon
its south wall, to the newly erected Temple of Ancestors, the
eastern wall of which marks the limits of the Legation
grounds. The festival was in no way public; yet, such was
the splendour of the pageant, that this progress of eight
hundred yards, leaving the Palace by its south gate
and entering again by the eastern gate, cost over
two thousand pounds. No warning of the Imperial plans
was given to his Majesty’s subjects. Just before the hour
of his departure, however, the Emperor expressed the hope
that the British Minister and myself would be interested in
the procession, inviting us to watch the spectacle from the
Legation domain. Information of the movements of the
Court was, of course, bruited abroad. Large crowds
gathered around the precincts of the Palace and the Temple,
attracted by the efforts which the soldiers were making to
form a cordon round the scene. Hundreds of soldiers were
told off to guard the approaches to the Temple. One
battalion of infantry was installed in the grounds of the
Imperial Korean Customs, another occupied the gates and
garden of the British Legation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>Despite the fact that the route of the procession lay
between the high walls of a private passage, some twenty-five
feet wide, leading from the offices of the Customs to the
grounds of the Legation, into which a postern gate gives
access from the Palace, and through which no Korean is
ever permitted to pass, soldiers, one pace apart, faced one
another upon opposite sides of the road. The public, seeing
nothing of the ceremony, gathered such consolation as was
possible from the spectacle of the masses of infantry occupying
the Palace Square. Occasional glimpses of Palace
officials were also secured, and the blatant discord of
triumphant song, with which the private musicians of the
Emperor greeted his arrival and the passing of the Court,
fell faintly upon expectant ears. It is, however, the proud
privilege of the Koreans to pay for these promenades of the
Court. If they did not see the august countenance of his
Majesty upon this occasion, it is to be hoped that they derived
some consolation for the heavy taxation, with which they
are burdened, from the brave show made by the brand new
uniforms of the troops. The plumes, gold lace and swords
of the officers, and the rifles and bayonets of the men would
have fascinated any crowd. Until the moment of departure,
the army lay around upon the road, sleeping in the dust, or
squatted in the shade upon the steps of buildings, partaking
of breakfast—a decomposed mass of sun-dried, raw fish and
rice which stunk horribly, but which they devoured greedily,
tearing it into shreds with their fingers. Occasionally a loyal
citizen brought them water or passed round a pipe, taking
the opportunity to run his finger along the edge of a
bayonet, or over the surface of a coat.</p>

<p>The Emperor was passing in this festive state to pay
homage to the tablets of his ancestors upon their transference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
to a fresh abode. The gorgeousness of the pageant
burst upon the colourless monotony of the capital with
all the violent splendour and vivid beauty of an Arabian
sunset. It was right and proper that the magnificence of the
celebration should be unrestricted. The importance of the
occasion was without parallel in the festivals of the year. The
momentary brilliancy of the picture, which centres round
the usually secluded sovereign at such a moment, implied the
glorification of a dynasty, which has already occupied the
throne of Korea for more than five centuries. Quaint and
stately as the pageant was, the splendour of a barbaric
mediævalism is best seen in processions of a more public
character.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus30" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus30.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>WITHIN THE PALACE GROUNDS, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The procession started from the Palace about 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
It presented elements strangely suggestive of burlesque,
romance, and the humours of a pantomime. Korean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
infantry, in blue uniforms, headed the order of the advance
from the Palace, their modern dress and smart accoutrements
forming the one link between the middle ages and the
twentieth century, to which the function could lay claim.
After them, running, stumbling, and chattering noisily, passed
a mob of Palace attendants in fantastic hats and costumes
of various degrees of brilliancy, long silken robes of blue,
green, yellow, red and orange, carrying staves bound with
embroidered streamers of coloured ribbons. A line of
bannermen followed, bearing red silken flags with blue
characters, also hurrying and stumbling forward; then
passed a file of pipes and drums, the men in yellow robes
with the shimmer of gold about them, streamers fluttering
from the pipes, ribbons decking the drums. Men bearing
arrows in leather frames and flags of green, red and yellow,
were next. Soldiers in ancient costume, wonderful to behold,
men with bells and jingling cymbals, pipes and fans,
Palace eunuchs in Court dress, detachments of dismounted
cavalry, their horses not appearing, but their riders garbed
in voluminous shirts, their hats covered with feathers and
wearing high boots, swept along, amiable and foolish of
aspect.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="illus31" style="max-width: 23.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus31.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>IMPERIAL THRONE, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The procession, which preceded the passing of the
Emperor, seemed almost unending. At every moment the
sea of colour broke into waves of every imaginable hue,
as one motley crowd of retainers, servants, musicians and
officials gave place to another. Important and imposing
officials in high-crowned hats, adorned with crimson tassels
festooned with bunches of feathers and fastened by a string
of amber beads round the throat, were pushed along, silent
and helpless. Their dresses were glaring combinations of
red and blue and orange; they were supported by men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
in green gauze coats and followed by other signal marks
of Korean grandeur, more banners and bannermen, flags
decorated with feathers, servants carrying boxes of refreshments,
small tables, pipes and fire. These were succeeded
by others just as imposing, helpless and beautiful to behold;
the breasts and backs of their superb robes were decorated
with satin squares, embroidered, after the style of China,
with the symbols of their offices—birds for civilians, tigers
for those of military rank. Statesmen in their official robes
gave place to others in winged hats or lofty mitres, gleaming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
with tinsel. The Commander-in-Chief, with Japanese,
Chinese, and Korean decorations flashing in the sunshine
from the breast of his modern uniform, followed by his
staff in red coats heavily braided with gold lace, and with
white aigrettes waving in their hats, passed, marching
proudly at the head of the Imperial body-guard. The final
stream of colour showed nobles in blue and green silk
gauze; Imperial servants with robes of yellow silk, their
hats decorated with rosettes; more mediæval costumes,
of original colour and quaint conception; a greater multitude
of waving flags; a group of silken-clad standard-bearers
bearing the Imperial yellow silk flag, the Imperial
umbrella, and other insignia. Then a final frantic beating
of drums, a horrid jangling of bells, a fearful screaming
of pipes, a riot of imperious discord mingled with the voices
of the officials shouting orders and the curses of the eunuchs,
and finally the van of the Imperial <i>cortège</i> appeared, in
a blaze of streaming yellow light, amid a sudden silence
in which one could hear the heart-beats of one’s neighbour.
The voices died away; the scraping of hurried footsteps
alone was audible as the Imperial chair of state, canopied
with yellow silk richly tasselled, screened with delicate
silken panels of the same colour and bearing wings to keep
off the sun, was rushed swiftly and smoothly forward.
Thirty-two Imperial runners, clad in yellow, with double
mitres upon their heads, bore aloft upon their shoulders the
sacred and august person of his Imperial Majesty, the
Emperor, to his place of sacrifice and worship in his
Temple of Ancestors.</p>

<p>The business of the day had now arrived. Presently
the Emperor’s bearers stopped, and he alighted at the
entrance of a tent of yellow silk, which had been erected at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
the angle of the Palace and Legation walls, within the shade
of trees in the Legation garden. It was in this spot that
his Majesty had given us permission to watch the passing of
his Court. It was here, within a moment of his arrival, that
the retinue of the Crown Prince, his chair of red silk borne
upon the shoulders of sixteen bearers, stopped to set down
its princely burden. The Emperor and the Crown Prince
passed within the tent, changing the Imperial yellow and
crimson robes of state in which they had first appeared for
the sacrificial yellow silk, and emerging a little later to make
obeisance before the passing of the tablets of their ancestors.
The character of the procession was now modified. Soldiers
and courtiers, nobles and dignitaries of the Court, gave
place to priests clothed in the yellow robes of sacrifice, and
chanting in solemn tones the words of benediction. The
screaming of pipes took on fresh vigour, rising and falling
in shrill cadence, until the air vibrated with conflicting
discords. Men, solemn of visage, their yellow skirts swaying
with the frenzy of their movements, swept past the
throne, a surge of song rising to their lips expressive of the
passionate despair and lamentation which (should have)
filled their souls. They disappeared, a mocking echo
haunting their retreating footsteps. Again the music of
the priests broke forth in noisy triumph, heralding the
presence of the twelve ancestral tablets, each carried by
eight men in chairs of sacrificial yellow, which demanded
the homage of the expectant pair. One came, moving
slowly in a burst of solemn song. The Emperor, his son
the Crown Prince, and the baby Prince, the offspring of
Lady Om, dropped to the earth. For a moment they rested
upon their bended knees, with crossed hands, in a reverent
attitude, as their own proud heads sank to the dust before
the gilded burdens in the sacred chairs. Twelve times they
passed before the Imperial group; twelve times each Prince
humbled himself, the circle of supporting nobles and
attendant eunuchs assisting them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus32" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus32.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>IMPERIAL TABLET-HOUSE, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>It was the first appearance of the baby Prince. Scarcely
old enough to toddle, he was of necessity aided in his devotions
by the chief eunuch, who pressed him to his knees,
placing a restraining hand upon his head, a guiding hand
upon his shoulder. The babe followed everything with
wide-open, innocent eyes, becoming tired and fidgety before
the ceremony had concluded. The demeanour of the
Imperial pair showed every sign of reverence and devotion.
The absolute sincerity of their humiliation impressed those
who watched the scene with feelings of astonishment. The
emotion of the Emperor was plainly manifest; he had
paled visibly, his whole being centred upon the objects of
his veneration. When the ceremony had ended the twelve
chairs turned towards the Ancestral Temple, and, as the
Emperor ensconced himself in his yellow chair of state,
and the Crown Prince, following the example of his father,
mounted to his seat of crimson silk, the babe rode upon
the back of the chief eunuch, crowing with boyish and
infantile delight. Once again the flourish of the musicians,
the rattle of the drums, the screaming of the fifes and pipes
broke forth. The procession was moving, priests and
nobles, courtiers and Palace servants following in the train
of the Emperor.</p>

<p>The procession of the Emperor pressed forward to the
temple, the tablets halting before the Temple of Ancestors,
while the Emperor and the two Princes proceeded to the
Hall of Sacrifice, where offerings of live sheep were burnt,
and baskets of fruit and flowers presented before the altars.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
The spirits of the illustrious dead thus propitiated, the
Emperor returned to the sacred chairs, once again paying
his devotion to the tablets. One by one each was borne
from its chair to the receptacle prepared for its future keeping.
Panels of yellow silk screened them; no eye was
permitted to gaze upon them, nor any hand to touch them,
as each, wrapped in its inviolate sanctity of yellow silk,
passed from its chair of state to its holy place. Priests
attended them; the throne followed in their wake, the
entire Court, the highest nobles and statesmen in the land,
bowed down to them. An atmosphere at once devotional
and filial prevailed, for the cult of Ancestor Worship epitomises
the loftiest aspirations of the Korean. It governs the
actions of a parent towards his child; controls the conduct
of a child towards its parent.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus33.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>AN IMPERIAL PAVILION, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The ceremony over, the scene within the Temple became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
more brilliant. Ladies from the Palace appeared. Cakes
and wine were produced, and the Emperor and Crown
Prince resumed their robes of state, discarding the sacrificial
garments. The Lady Om came to congratulate the
Emperor, attended by a retinue of gaily-dressed Palace
women and slaves, their hair piled high, their shimmering
silken skirts trailing in graceful folds about them. The Court
musicians played; the Court singers sang, and the prettiest
women swayed in a joyous dance. Within the private
apartments of the sovereign there was feasting and merriment.
His Majesty was himself again. The world, which
he had shown us, and in which we had been so interested,
changed quickly. Looking at the disorderly scramble of
the return, the scene that had passed before us seemed
like a dream. Yet, for a few hours, we had been living
in the shadow of the middle ages.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>Sketch of Mr. McLeavy Brown—The Question of the Customs—The
suggested Loan</p>

</div>

<p>It is perhaps curious that the man who has held the Korean
State together, during the past few years, should be British—one
of those sons of the Empire, upon whose work the
present generation looks with satisfaction. It is nearly thirty
years ago since Mr. McLeavy Brown made his appearance
in China. To-day, among Englishmen whose reputations
are associated with the problems and politics of the Far
East, his name stands out almost as prominently as that of
his colleague, Sir Robert Hart, the Inspector-General of the
Imperial Maritime Customs of China. Seconded from the
Chinese Customs for special duty, Mr. McLeavy Brown has
devoted many years of his life to the financial difficulties
which beset Korea, holding at first the dual position of
Treasurer-General and Chief Commissioner of Customs.
Within the last few years, Mr. McLeavy Brown’s activity has
been confined to the administration of the Customs Service,
where, though deprived of the unique and influential position
filled by him as financial adviser to the Emperor, he
has succeeded in accomplishing invaluable work for the
country.</p>

<p>A man may be judged by the character of those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
gather round him, and when, weary of the carping and
pettiness that prevail in Seoul, one turns to the service which
Mr. McLeavy Brown represents, it is to find his colleagues
animated by a quiet enthusiasm, and a spirit of generous
devotion, and loyalty
to his principles and
policy. Unfortunately,
his supporters
are not in the capital,
and he can derive no
encouragement from
their sympathy. Their
sphere of work lies
in the treaty ports,
but he is content to
remain in Seoul always
fighting, in grim
and stoical silence,
against the absurd
extravagances of the
Court, and the infamous
corruption of the officials. So long as he perseveres
in this duty, just so long will he be hampered and
thwarted in all quarters. The very opposition which he
encounters, however, is no unemphatic testimony to the
exceeding and exceptional value of the work which he has
already achieved, in the face of every obstacle to systematic
progress and reform, that the craft and cunning of officialdom
can devise.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="illus34" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus34.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Mr. J. McLeavy Brown</span>, C.M.G., LL. D.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The animus which prevails against Mr. McLeavy Brown
occasions, to those who are new to Seoul, sentiments of
profound astonishment and dismay, but after the first feeling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
of strangeness has worn off, and it becomes possible to grasp
the peculiar and complex variety of people who have gathered
in the capital of the Hermit Kingdom, the causes responsible
for the existence of such an opinion are very plainly revealed.
Apart from the Legations, there are few foreigners, not even
excepting the representatives of the very miscellaneous
collection of American missionaries, who have not come to
Seoul from motives of self-interest, which bring them into
collision, directly or indirectly, with the Chief Commissioner
of the Customs in his official capacity. If no longer the
financial adviser of the Government, his counsel is sought
as occasion arises; although his advice is not necessarily
followed, it frequently happens that the influence of the Chief
Commissioner of the Customs becomes the controlling factor
in the negotiations between a bewildered and impecunious
Court and an importunate concession-hunter. Moreover,
cases may occur when an upright regard for the interests
of the kingdom makes it incumbent upon Mr. McLeavy
Brown to urge the rejection of proposals, which have
not come through the channels of his own office. Such a
variation of the orthodox method of application may happen
any day in Seoul. While this attempted exercise of a
power of veto does not endear him to the seeker after
Ministerial “considerations,” the impersonal spirit, in which
he discharges the functions of his office, atones for any
exceptional interference he may deem necessary. Much of
the feeling which actuates foreigners and officials against
Mr. McLeavy Brown, therefore, is based upon a thoughtless
disregard for the elementary facts in his very delicate position.
There is, of course, no suggestion against his honour. In a
community, accustomed to the financial backsliding which
appears to be an inevitable preliminary to any concession,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the exponent of a policy of economy and straight dealing
always provokes the strongest animosity in those about
him.</p>

<p>A more emotional man than the Chief Commissioner
would have tired of the thankless part which he is compelled
to play. Years of laborious work, and the habit, which
he has acquired in the isolated state in which he lives, of
concentrating his energies upon the subject before him,
enable him to school himself against the trials of his
situation. He treats every one with unfailing frankness and
directness, but the kindly instincts which illuminate his
private life are submerged in the cares and worry of his
official position. During business hours he becomes the
cold, irresponsive machine of State; his whole imagination
and ingenuity focused upon the necessity of checking
those who would incite their Sovereign to acts subversive of
the principles of financial rectitude, which Mr. McLeavy
Brown would fain see encouraged.</p>

<p>Only those who have had experience of Korea can
thoroughly appreciate the fertility of the Korean official
in inventing new schemes by which public money may
be appropriated to his private uses. If the condition
of the finances had not already made the practice of
economy imperative, this tendency would justify the determination
to deny the means of peculation to officials.
Mr. McLeavy Brown has therefore brought into accord the
necessity of economy, which underlies the existence of the
Customs, with the principles of the system upon which he
administers the service. It is, in the matter of the foreign
staff of the Korean Customs, impossible for Korean officials
to take exception to the standard of payment by which
the services of these foreigners are compensated. If this all-pervading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
retrenchment makes employment in the Korean
Customs exceptionally unsatisfactory to its minor foreign
officials, a very clear reason for the low payment is nevertheless
found in the narrow margin which divides the total
revenue from the total expenditure. Moreover, the Chief
Commissioner is himself the chief sufferer.</p>

<p>Mr. McLeavy Brown has long been an enigma in Seoul.
Although the variety of his gifts and the hospitable quality
of his nature make him an important element in the life
of the capital, there are few who care to study the man and
his movements intelligently. Mr. McLeavy Brown possesses
many moods; and the isolation in which he is placed, by
the absence of any sympathy between himself and the
people among whom he lives, renders the circumstances of
his position almost pathetic. When, in 1896, he refused to
accept any salary for the hopeless and onerous post of
Financial Comptroller of the Imperial Treasury, the foreign
community of Seoul were astounded. This refusal to
burden still further the resources of an exhausted country
is, however, an index to the guiding principles of his life.
There is no dissembling in his transactions. Although
he may temper an ill wind with promises, the continuity
of his decision is maintained, and he attempts to carry
out independently and honestly anything to which he may
have pledged himself. He is indefatigable in his work;
indomitable in his perseverance, cool and determined. A
barrister by profession, he devotes himself to the minutiæ
of his service with an attention which discloses his legal
training. In his estimate of a person, no less than a
situation, he seldom errs.</p>

<p>In his official life he represents a type of Englishman
that is rapidly disappearing from our public services. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
private life reflects the culture and the grace of an attractive
personality. They say, in Seoul, that Mr. McLeavy Brown
is more skilful as a diplomatist than as an administrator;
and his brilliant conversational powers give some colour
to the assertion. Upon arrival in Seoul, newcomers are apt
to hear that “Brown is a walking encyclopædia.” He
speaks, reads and writes with equal facility French, German,
Italian and Chinese. It will be remembered that he is in the
service of the Korean Government, a sphere of utility and
activity which demands fluency in yet another language. His
library attests the breadth of his culture; it numbers some
7000 volumes, and fills the walls of the rooms and corridors
of his house at Seoul from floor to ceiling. Boxes of new
books arrive by every mail. When he reads them it is
difficult to conjecture. At night, as one strolls from the
British Legation to the Station Hotel, the lights in his
study window may be seen burning brightly. He is believed
to sit up with his books very often until dawn. It would be
typical of this silent self-contained man if he found in
the pleasures of his library the antidote to much which
takes place in Seoul.</p>

<p>When his Imperial Majesty was pleased to demand the
private residence and official premises of his Chief Commissioner
of Customs, there was much perturbation in
Seoul about the disturbances, which were expected to take
place upon the expiration of the Emperor’s ultimatum.
Preparations were made for such a contingency, and four
British men-of-war under Admiral Bruce appeared at
Chemulpo. The eventful day passed quietly, however, and
excitement gave place to no small amount of disappointment
among the European community. Mr. McLeavy
Brown remained in possession of his usual quarters, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
whole question of a change in the location of the Customs
having been reserved by the officials of the Court. Unfortunately,
the demands of the Court could only be contested
in so far as they continued to be peremptory in their
nature. When, later, due warning was given to the Chief
Commissioner and a fresh domicile appointed, as a servant
of the Crown Mr. McLeavy Brown was unable to ignore
the mandate. Prior to this notice, the Emperor had insisted,
very foolishly, upon the immediate evacuation of the Customs
buildings, a demand compliance with which was impossible,
and in resistance to which Mr. McLeavy Brown was very
properly supported by Mr. J. G. Gubbins, C.M.G., then
acting Consul-General to Korea.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus35" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus35.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BRITISH LEGATION, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After the murder of the Queen in 1895, the Korean Court
fled from the old Palace, in the least healthy part of the city,
to the vicinity of the British and American Legations, and
built there a new Palace in a safer and more pleasant
locality. But the new Palace is overlooked by the British
Legation and by the residence of Mr. McLeavy Brown.
The Emperor, spurred on by his eunuchs, had cast envious
glances on the dwellings of these foreigners, and not
unnaturally decided that these properties would make a
very pleasing addition to the Palace which he is now constructing.
Unhappily, there was reason to suspect that, in
turning the Chief Commissioner out of his house, the
Emperor, or rather Lady Om, who desired the house, and
Yi Yong-ik, who coveted the Customs, hoped at the same
time to expel him from the country. That the attempt to
oust Mr. McLeavy Brown from his home really aimed at removing
him from office can hardly be doubted. When the
house question rose, Mr. McLeavy Brown was given exactly
two days notice—from the 19th to the 21st March—to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
move out. When he refused to accept such an intimation,
force was threatened, but averted by the intervention of the
British <i>chargé d’affaires</i>. In the end, Mr. McLeavy Brown’s
compound was entered by a few hangers-on of the palace,
who were easily ejected by the orders of the Chief Commissioner
of the Customs. These creatures then tore their
clothes and ran crying to the Palace that they had been
beaten and otherwise shamefully ill-used. As a result, the
dismissal of the Chief Commissioner was demanded. Mr.
Gubbins took the matter up with great promptness, and
agreed that, upon certain conditions, which included a
proper notice to quit and the choice of new sites, the
Emperor might acquire both the British Legation and the
Customs buildings, which were apparently necessary to the
completion of the new Palace. As it happens, the British
Legation, which directly overlooks the half-finished Palace,
is far more necessary to the Emperor’s peace of mind than
the Customs buildings, which are upon a lower level. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
obvious, therefore, that the attack was directed more against
Mr. McLeavy Brown, by a <i>posse</i> of Court officials, than
against his house. Nevertheless, it has always been apparent,
since the Emperor came over to the shelter of the Legations,
that there could be no sufficient accommodation for him in
the Foreign quarter without encroaching on the grounds of
the Legations. The Legations have a delightful situation
on the only real eminence in the central part of Seoul, and
the Emperor, now that he has come, must either be content
with a malarial situation, at the feet, as it were, of the
foreigners, or absorb the Legation grounds and send their
tenants elsewhere. Already he has displaced the German
Minister. Sooner or later the British, and perhaps the
American, will go too; and the Palace will then cover the
whole hill, save the site of the Russian Legation, whose
flag will still wave a little above the Imperial standard of
Korea.</p>

<p>No sooner had a settlement been attained upon the
question at issue between the Court and the Chief Commissioner
of the Customs, than there came the announcement
that a loan of five million yen had been arranged
between the Government and the Yunnan Syndicate, upon
the security of the revenue of the Customs. This at once
compromised the authority of the Chief Commissioner,
who, by virtue of his office, exercises absolute control over
the revenues. It should be understood that the loan had
nothing whatever to do with the question of Mr. McLeavy
Brown’s house. The original proposals were first mooted a
year before the more recent trouble. The Yunnan Syndicate,
a French company registered in London, is supported
almost wholly by French capital. It is generally understood
that the main object of the loan was to obtain a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
weapon by which unlimited concessions might be extorted.
The manœuvre was not altogether successful. The Yunnan
Syndicate, by the terms of the agreement, bound itself to
lend the Korean Government five million yen in gold and
silver bullion at 5½ per cent., the loan to be subject to a
charge of 10 per cent. for commission, and to be repaid in
instalments stretching over twenty-five years. In case the
Korean Government were unable to repay the money out of
the ordinary sources of revenue, the Customs revenue had
been pledged as security. The agreement was signed by
Pak, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Yi Yong-ik, the
Minister of Finance, on the one hand, and by M. Cazalis,
agent of the company, and M. Colin de Plancy, French
Minister at Seoul, on the other. The document left many
points open. It was particularly vague in that no date
was fixed for the delivery of the gold and silver bullion at
Chemulpo. It was therefore argued, with obvious reason,
that the Syndicate might turn this oversight to account by
simply refusing to deliver the money until certain concessions
had been granted.</p>

<p>M. Cazalis, the agent of the Yunnan Syndicate, Limited,
was indignant that he should find himself opposed both by
Mr. Gubbins and Mr. McLeavy Brown, who, according to
his view, followed the Japanese lead in suspecting Russian
intrigue. There is no reason, however, to believe that the
British <i>chargé d’affaires</i> based his objections upon any such
grounds. The scheme of the Yunnan Syndicate was quite
iniquitous enough to meet with opposition for <i>primâ facie</i>
reasons. Here are the facts of the case as stated by the
representative of the company. The Yunnan Syndicate,
without consulting the Chief Commissioner of the Customs,
the Japanese Minister, or the British Minister, secretly persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
the Korean Government to borrow five million yen
in gold and silver bullion at 5½ per cent., giving the Customs
revenue as security. M. Cazalis argued that it was necessary
to carry the matter through with secresy, because it would
have been impossible to procure any signatures to the
document, if the affair had been conducted publicly, with
the full knowledge of the Chief Commissioner of the Customs.
In other words, he admitted that the scheme was such as
would never have commended itself to Mr. McLeavy Brown,
who was absolutely impartial and without interest in the
matter.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it is as well to note that the loan aimed
at creating a position for French interests in Korea. In
view of the attempt of Russia to acquire an open and ice-free
port for her own purposes, and the distinct understanding
existing between the French and Russian Governments with
regard to Russia’s Asiatic policy, Great Britain could not
disregard any possible development. At that moment French
activity in Korea may not have involved any direct menace
to our own interests. Nevertheless, any combination of
circumstances which gave to French and Russian influence
a predominance in the administration of the country, could
scarcely fail to develop incidents, against which it is our
manifest duty to guard. And it is perhaps curious, moreover,
that the man who was the prime mover in the intrigue
to dispossess Mr. McLeavy Brown of his house should
have been the very one to arrange the loan from the Yunnan
Syndicate with M. Cazalis.</p>

<p>If the wisdom and necessity of a loan of five millions
had been assured, there are many directions in Korea in
which such a sum could be most profitably spent. With
the revenue of the Customs as the guarantee, there would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
have been no difficulty in securing more advantageous conditions
than those of the contract. The terms were preposterous.
Subsidiary proposals, as to which no conclusion
was then reached, further demanded the lease of the Pyöng-yang
coal-mines, the control of forty-four additional mines,
the purchase of French mining plant, the engagement of
French mining experts, and involved minor stipulations,
which were in themselves objectionable to the Court, while
giving to French interests in Korea an unwarranted and
undesirable preponderance. The uses to which it was
alleged that the loan would be put were precisely those
which are actually most necessary. Unanimous support
for the loan would have been won if there had been the
slightest reason to hope for the faithful observance by the
Court of its pledges. Unhappily, there is no prospect that
any very appreciable proportion of the loan will be expended
upon the objects on which such stress was laid,
objects which are potent and vital factors in the economic
development of the kingdom. The loan was handed over
in bullion; in the ratio of one-third silver and two-thirds
gold, ostensibly that a National bank may be inaugurated
and the present nickel coinage replaced by gold and
silver tokens. This is eminently laudable. If the small
dimensions of the loan rendered such a thing feasible,
the conversion of the national money would be of incalculable
benefit to the financial credit of the Government and
the country in general. But it must be remembered that one
of the reasons for contracting the last Japanese loan was to
provide a nickel coinage exchangeable at par with the
Japanese and Mexican silver tokens. Unhappily, this
same coinage is now at a discount of 120 per cent. for
one hundred Japanese cents gold. Examination has proved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
that the intrinsic value of one dollar nickel of Korean five
cent pieces—at that time the only unit struck—is only one-eighteenth
of its face value as against the Japanese gold
standards of currency. The balance was “squeezed.” It
is likewise impossible to make provision for the legitimate
and honourable expenditure of this new loan. Quite
recently there has been a large issue of one-cent copper
pieces. These coins sustain a better ratio to the yen than
the nickel currency; as a matter of fact the intrinsic value
of the copper coinage is so much greater than the nickel
money that there is a standard of exchange between them.
At present the nickel, compared with the copper, token is
quoted at 12 per cent. discount.</p>

<p>Foreign action in Korea—Exhausted Exchequer—Taxes—Budgets—Debased
currency—The Dai Ichi ginko—Dishonest
officials</p>

</div>

<p>The events, which have led up to the present complex condition
of Korean politics, originated in the attempt of the
Russians to secure control of the Customs and Finance of
the Empire in the autumn of 1897. As the effort of the
Russian Minister of that time, M. de Speyer, was only in
part successful, his immediate successor, M. Matunine, the
present representative, M. Pavloff, and his <i>confrère</i> of the
French Legation, M. Colin de Plancy, have in the interval consistently
directed their diplomacy to the completion of the
task. Their inability to force compliance with their demands
upon the Korean Government has embittered their action<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
towards the British Minister and the Chief Commissioner
of the Customs. In the prosecution of a work, at once
discreditable and inspired by very petty prejudices, no
single diplomatic device, which could serve their purpose,
has been omitted from their policy. The check, which the
plans of the Franco-Russian-Korean party received in consequence
of British action has only retarded their development
for the moment. It does not perceptibly relieve the
situation, nor make the office of the Chief Commissioner
more comfortable or the path of the British Minister more
easy to follow. Indeed, it is quite certain that the opposition
of the Russian and French Ministers to British activity will
become more vigorous in the future.</p>

<p>The assistance accorded by the British Government to
Mr. Gubbins during the recent crisis, has done much to
dispel from the minds of the Koreans those illusions which
our past indifference had created. It is improbable that
quite identical methods will be employed in any future
attempt of the Court to oust Mr. McLeavy Brown from his
position. If the Court gave way in the face of the British
demonstration, the tact and consideration for the interests
of both parties, which Mr. Gubbins subsequently displayed,
materially contributed to the restoration of the <i>status quo</i>.
Upon the other hand, the apathy of the British Government
in failing to protect Mr. McLeavy Brown when
he was deprived of the Comptrollership of the Finances
at the instigation of the Russian Minister, in 1897, was
of course conducive to the late disturbances. The
two offices are so closely related, and the masterful and
aggressive spirit of the Franco-Russian policy is such,
that the accession of a Russian or French nominee
to the Chief Commissionership of the Customs would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
imply their subsequent fusion to the complete obliteration
of British influence. This, of course, should be
impossible; and it would be, if the British Government
would awaken to the importance of maintaining unimpaired
its prestige in Korea. We have little material interest in
Korea, but it must not be forgotten that our position in the
kingdom should be superior to that of France, and equal
to that of Russia. If it were not that France is the partisan
and ally of Russia in Korea, as well as elsewhere, there
would be no occasion to do aught but support benevolently
the policy of Japan, without unnecessarily endorsing the
aggressiveness which distinguishes the attitude of the Island
Empire to its neighbour. But if we wish to preserve our
position we must put a little more vigour into our policy,
and, while maintaining our working agreement with Japan,
proceed to guarantee the integrity of our own interests.
These would be best served by insisting upon the retention
of a British nominee in the supervision of the Korean
Maritime Customs. Our action in this respect would meet
with the unqualified approval of Japan and the United
States of America, whose trading interests, equally with our
own, justify predominance in this control.</p>

<p>The financial embarrassment of the Korean Government,
at the present time, is the outcome of the abnormal extravagance
of the Court. Anything which would tend to increase
the load of debt with which the Emperor encumbers the
dwindling resources of the national wealth, is neither politic
nor desirable. The sources of the Imperial revenue resemble
in lesser degree those which prevail in China. There are
the Land Tax, paid no longer in grain, which returned four
and a half of the seven million yen odd, composing the total
domestic revenue in 1901; a House Tax, assessed capriciously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
and evaded by the practice of a little discreet bribery; the net
Customs revenue, which was returned for 1901 at more than
one million and a quarter yen (1,325,414 yen; £135,303
sterling at exchange of 2<i>s.</i> 0½<i>d.</i>), and the proceeds of the
various concessions, monopolies, mines, and mint, and
the sums derived from such miscellaneous and irregular
taxation as may suggest itself to that keen-witted Minister Yi
Yong-ik.</p>

<p>Taxation is heavy and relentless. The list of the more
important objects, upon which an impost is levied, includes,
in addition to the land, customs and house taxes, salt,
tobacco, fish, fur, lumber lands, minerals, ginseng, minting,
cargo-boats, guilds, licences, paper, cowhides, pawnbroking,
&amp;c. In more recent times certain taxes have become
obsolete. But this list, however, does not by any means
exhaust the means by which the Emperor contrives to make
his subjects “pay the piper.” Quite subsidiary to the
regular cases, but of great value in themselves, are the
donations which are sent up from various parts of the
country for the gratification of the Throne. These gifts are
very comprehensive, and embrace the fruits of the land as
well as the products of the sea. Little escapes the schedule
of donations, and no intervention can bring about the
discontinuation of the custom, while a failure on the part of
a prefect to attend to this matter would result speedily
enough in the loss of his office.</p>

<p>The Budget for the year 1901 was assessed at nine
million yen odd, of which one million yen odd was
dedicated to Imperial expenditure, and a trifle more than
this sum paid to the Imperial Privy Purse. The estimated
difference between the revenue and the expenditure
of the same year was the small sum of 775 dollars.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
The Budget for 1902 provided for seven and a half
million yen; the estimated revenue was placed approximately
at the same figures, the balance between expenditure
and revenue being 653 yen. It will be seen, therefore, that
there is little reason for the financial difficulties in which
the Throne is placed. If it were not that his Majesty frittered
away his income upon the purchase of land, the adornment
of his Palaces and his person, his relatives, his women, and
the perpetual entertainment of his Court, this chronic impoverishment
of his exchequer would not exist. Moreover,
at least one quarter of his revenue is appropriated by the
native officials through whose hands it passes. Under these
circumstances he has never been averse from accepting the
assistance of interested parties; but this ill-omened relief
does not free the country from its burden of mortgage and
taxation.</p>

<p>The disbursements upon the different departments engage
the revenue to a degree which is out of all relation to the
precise utility or importance of any of these fantastic bureaux.
The War Office claimed in 1901, in round figures, more than
three and one half million yen, and the Foreign Office a
quarter of a million yen, the Finance Department three-quarters
of a million yen, the Palace a little more than
one million yen, and the Home Department a little less
than that amount. One million yen is roughly £100,000.
The amount paid to the War Office for 1902 was, in round
figures, very nearly three million yen; to the Foreign Office,
something in excess of a quarter of a million yen; to the
Finance Department, rather more than half a million yen.
The Departments of Law, Agriculture, Police, Education,
and Communications in this highly expensive and
totally inefficient administration, all make good their claims<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
upon the Budget, until there is nothing left and very
little to show for this lavish distribution of the public
moneys.</p>

<p>The Budget for 1903 I give in detail:—</p>

<p>The total revenue is estimated at $10,766,115. The total expenditure
is estimated at $10,765,491. This leaves a balance of $624.</p>

<p>Steps have been taken from time to time by the
Foreign Representatives to improve the finances of the
country. Upon one occasion seven reforms were recommended,
and the report subsequently presented to
his Majesty. In the course of an inquiry it transpired
that, in addition to nickels which were minted by the Government,
there were more than twenty-five separate and distinct
brands of nickels then circulating in Korea. Until recent
years the counterfeiting of Korean currency has not been
remunerative. The old time cash was of such small value,
and the combined cost of the metal and work together so
nearly equalled the face value of the true token, that the
risk was not commensurate with the profit. A single nickel
of the present currency, however, is equivalent to twenty-five
of the old coinage, and as the net cost of their
manufacture is less than a cent and a half a-piece, it will
be seen that there is some incentive to the production
of false money. The number of counterfeit nickels is rapidly
increasing, and permits to coin were at one time freely issued
by the Government to private individuals. Nickel is openly
imported through the Customs; spurious coins in large
quantities are brought by almost every steamer from Japan
and smuggled into the country. The Government care
only for the profit which they derive from their illegitimate
transaction, and, ignoring the permanent injury which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
are doing to the solvency of the country, adopt every
means to circulate these depreciated coins. Until quite
lately the circulation of nickel pieces was confined to the
capital and the vicinity of two or three Treaty ports, the old
copper cash being current elsewhere. With a view to
extending their use, however, the magistrates throughout
the Empire were ordered to accept redemption of taxes only
in this currency. But as wages are generally paid in the
nickel currency, and as the purchasing power of the nickel
Korean dollar is less than half it was with copper cash,
while the standard of payment remains the same, the bulk
of the nation is paid no better than formerly, while the
purchasing power of their earnings is infinitely less. There
appears no prospect of any immediate improvement,
since the Government contracted for the issue of a
further forty million nickels. With this accomplished, the
face value of the coinage in circulation, as against the
Japanese gold yen, will be fourteen million yen, or nearly
one million and a half pounds sterling. There is, of
course, no gold or silver reserve with which to redeem
this gigantic sum.</p>

<p>To such a pitch has this condition of affairs attained that
in Chemulpo quotations are current for:—</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) Government nickels;</li>
<li>(2) First-class counterfeits;</li>
<li>(3) Medium counterfeits; and</li>
<li>(4) Those passable only after dark.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is little wonder, therefore, that the currency question
is engaging the earnest attention of the foreign representatives.
Awakening at last to some sense of its responsibilities
in this matter, the Japanese Government issued, on
November 7th, 1902, an Imperial ordinance, which came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
into force on the 15th, with a view to deterring Japanese from
making spurious coins or despatching such nickels of
Japanese manufacture to Korea. The punishment to which
offenders against the ordinance are liable is imprisonment
for a period not exceeding one year or a fine of not more
than 200 yen (£20 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>). This enactment gave the
Japanese customs officers power to prevent the counterfeit
coins from being shipped abroad, and enabled the Korean
customs authorities to institute proceedings against Japanese
found guilty of importing nickels of this description. From
January 22nd, 1902, when the first seizure of the year took
place, until the close of December, 3,573,138 pieces (coins
and blanks), the total face value being £18,191, were confiscated
by the Chemulpo customs officers. The largest
quantity taken at one time was 739,000 pieces, face value
£3772, detected on August 19th aboard a Korean junk, the
second largest haul was made on September 8th in a cargo-boat,
and consisted of 530,090 pieces, with a face value of
£2512.</p>

<p>With a view to provide a remedy against the deplorable
condition of the Korean currency, a Japanese Bank, Dai
Ichi Ginko (No. I. Bank), which is under direction of Baron
Shibusawa, decided, with the support of the Japanese
Government, to undertake the issue of notes by which a
promise was made to pay the bearer on demand in Japanese
currency at any of its branches in Korea. The Dai Ichi
Ginko possesses branches at all the larger Treaty ports, as
well as in Seoul, and is, perhaps, the most important commercial
agent in the country. The Japanese Consular
officers are authorised to supervise the issue and to receive
statements of the circulation and reserves twice a month.
They are also entrusted with certain discretionary powers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
as to limiting the number of notes in use. The denomination
of the notes are 1 yen (2<i>s.</i> 0½<i>d.</i>), 5 yen (10<i>s.</i> 2½<i>d.</i>),
10 yen (£1 0<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>), and on May 10th, 1902, there appeared
the first issue of notes of 1 yen value. Those of 5 yen were
put in circulation on September 20th following. The 10 yen
notes were not issued until a later time.</p>

<p>On February 28th, 1903, the circulation of Dai Ichi
Ginko notes and the reserves held for their redemption stood
as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th colspan="2">Amount.</th>

<p>This action upon the part of the Dai Ichi Ginko gave
rise to vehement opposition from the Korean Government.
Although the issue of the notes was duly authorised by the
Emperor, the Minister of Foreign Affairs persistently obstructed
the circulation of the notes. Upon September 11th,
1902, an order was issued from the Foreign Office, upon the
authority of the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, prohibiting
the use of the notes by Koreans upon grounds
which impugned the credit of the entire proceeding. This
order was inspired, of course, by Yi Yong-ik, and when a
few months later, on January 8th, 1903, Cho Pyöng-sik—then
Foreign Minister—removed the prohibition, Yi Yong-ik
at once contrived the dismissal of his too complaisant colleague.
The Foreign Office was now without its Chancellor,
and Yi Yong-ik immediately set himself to revoke the
charter of the bank. After declaring that the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
paper-money would be the ruin of the country and alleging
that the compensation claims against the Seoul-Fusan Railway
Company were purposely paid in those notes with a
view to an ultimate declaration of bankruptcy upon behalf of
the bank, Yi Yong-ik summoned on January 24th a meeting
of the Pedlar’s Guild, at which he forbade their acceptance
of this paper-money. A few days later, February 1st, the
Mayor of Seoul posted an edict throughout the city giving
effect to this prohibition and, at the same time, threatening
with most severe penalties any one who used the notes or
in any way assisted to circulate them. The Finance Department
then circulated the edict throughout the provinces,
whereupon an immediate run upon the bank ensued. Three
days later, upon February 4th, the Acting Japanese Minister
threatened the Government with the demand of an indemnity
and a number of mining and railway concessions in compensation
for the injury occasioned the bank, unless the
obnoxious measure was withdrawn. After considerable
discussion and various meetings, the Korean authorities
agreed to withdraw all obstruction and to publish
throughout the Empire their recognition of the existence
of the bank. From that day the validity of the position of
the Dai Ichi Ginko has been unquestioned.</p>

<p>The exactions and dishonesty of the officials impose a
perpetual drain upon the national exchequer. In the
removal of this one great evil, another serious obstacle to a
more flourishing financial condition would be surmounted.
Unfortunately, the drought and famine of 1901, added to the
decrease in the revenues of 1902, created a discrepancy of
five million yen. If this deficit may be considered extraordinary,
no extenuating circumstances can excuse the
supplementary losses of revenue attributable to the personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
peculations of the officials. The stringency of the financial
situation created by the famine drew attention to the very
large deficits, with which many of the more important
metropolitan and chief provincial officials were debited.
The inability of any of these gentry to disgorge their ill-gotten
gains resulted in their immediate prosecution at the
instigation of the Finance Minister, Yi Yong-ik. Ministers
of State, governors of provinces, prefects and inspectors
were brought sharply to account by the execution, banishment,
or imprisonment of many offenders.</p>

<p>In such a moment the peculiar astuteness of Yi Yong-ik
becomes conspicuous. While he visited any official who
was compromised with the full penalties of the law, he
himself executed, in his capacity of Minister of Finance,
a bluff by which he netted almost half a million
yen for the Imperial Treasury at one stroke. Yi
Yong-ik arranged to buy the ginseng crop from the ginseng
farmers. This is a Government monopoly, and the
price was arranged at eight dollars a pound for sixty-three
thousand pounds’ weight, dried and undried. When the
time came to pay, and he had secured possession of the
ginseng, Yi Yong-ik refused to give more than one dollar
a pound, alleging that the ginseng growers had misrepresented
the condition and weight of the consignment. In
the meantime the ginseng was sold; the money was appropriated,
and the balance in the Treasury correspondingly
increased.</p>

<p>Upon another occasion, at a time when the discount
of nickel against yen gold was very low, Yi Yong-ik was
instrumental in promoting the presentation of a gift of two
million dollars Korean to the Emperor. By careful adjustment
the value of the exchange, nickel currency as against yen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
gold, hardened twenty points the day after the presentation.
It is, perhaps, unnecessary to point out that Yi Yong-ik
occupied the interval in disposing of the difference to the
advantage of his master.</p>

<p>Education—Arts and graces—Penal code—Marriage and
divorce—The rights of concubines—Position of children—Government</p>

</div>

<p>Until the introduction of foreign methods of education,
and the establishment of schools upon modern lines, no
very promising manifestation of intellect distinguished the
Koreans. Even now, a vague knowledge of the Chinese
classics, which, in rare instances only can be considered a
familiar acquaintanceship, sums up the acquirements of the
cultured classes. The upper classes of both sexes make
some pretence of understanding the literature and language
of China; but it is very seldom that the middle classes are
able to read more than the mixed Chinese-Korean script of
the native Press—in which the grammatical construction is
purely Korean.</p>

<p>Despite the prevailing ignorance of Chinese, the Mandarin
dialect of China is considered the language of polite society.
It is the medium of official communication at the Court:
the majority of the foreigners in the service of the Government
have also mastered its intricacies. It has been estimated
by Professor Homer B. Hulbert, whose elaborate researches
in Korean and Chinese philology make him a distinguished
authority, that only one per cent. of the women of the upper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
class, who study Chinese, have any practical knowledge of
it. Women of the middle and lower classes are ignorant of
Chinese. Again, the proportion of upper class women who
can read the Chinese classics is very small. It is probable
that, out of an unselected assembly of Koreans, not more
than five per cent. would be found who could take up a
Chinese work and read it as glibly as a similar gathering of
English might be expected to read ordinary Latin prose.</p>

<p>In relation to the <i>ön-mun</i>, the common script of Korea,
there is, however, no such ignorance; the upper and middle
classes study their native writing with much intelligence.
The language of Korea is altogether different from that of
China and Japan; it possesses an alphabet of its own, which
at present consists of some twenty-five letters. It has been
ascribed by certain Korean annals to the fifteenth century,
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1447, when the King of Korea, resolving to assert his
independence by abandoning the use of Chinese writing as
the official medium of correspondence, invented an alphabet
to suit the special requirements of the vernacular. Conservatism
proved too strong, however, and the new script
was gradually relegated to the use of the lower classes, and
of women and children. There is an extensive literature in
the vernacular. It includes translations from the Chinese
and Japanese classics; historical works on modern and
mediæval Korea, books of travel and hunting, of poetry
and correspondence, and a range of fiction, dealing with
those phases of human nature that are common to mankind.</p>

<p>Many of these books are regularly studied by Korean
women, ignorance of their contents being regarded with
disdain by the women of the upper classes, and, in a less
pronounced degree, by those of the middle classes. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
female attendants in the Palace are the readiest students
and scholars of the vernacular, their positions at Court
requiring them to prepare <i>ön-mun</i> copies of Government
orders, current news, and general gossip, for Imperial use.
Books in native script are readily purchased by all conditions
of Koreans, and taken out from circulating libraries.
Many of the works are written in Chinese and in Korean
upon alternate pages for those who can read only one
or the other; those who are quite illiterate learning the more
important chapters by ear. A work, with which every
woman is supposed to be intimate, is entitled The Three
Principles of Conduct, the great divisions being (1) The
Treatment of Parents; (2) The Rearing of a Family; (3)
Housekeeping. Companion books with this volume, and
of equal importance to Korean women, are the Five Rules
of Conduct and the Five Volumes of Primary Literature,
which, in spirit and contents, are almost identical. They
deal with the relations between (1) Parent and Child; (2)
King and Subject; (3) Husband and Wife; (4) Old and
Young; (5) Friend and Friend. They contain also exhortations
to virtue and learning.</p>

<p>Apart from the direction and scope of female education
in Korea, which I have now suggested, the theoretical study
of the domestic arts is an invariable accompaniment of the
more intricate studies. It is supplemented with much actual
experiment. As a consequence, while the education of men
of certain rank is confined to the books to which they are
but indifferently attentive, a wide range of study exists for
women apart from the writings and teachings of the
accepted professors and classical authorities. Ornamental
elegances, the tricks and traits of our drawing-room minxes,
are ignored by the gentler classes, vocal music and dancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
being the accomplishments of dancing-girls and <i>demi-mondaines</i>.
The arts of embroidery, dressmaking, sewing, and
weaving absorb their attention until they have gone through
the gamut of domestic economy. Occasionally women
of the upper class learn to play the <i>kumungo</i>, an instrument
some five feet long and one foot wide, bearing a faint
resemblance to a zither and emitting a melancholy and
discordant wail. There is one other stringed weapon, the
<i>nageum</i>, but the awful screech of this unhappy viol overwhelms
me, even in recollection. The usual and most
simple amusement for the middle classes is the gentle,
aimless stroll, for the purpose of “look see.” Swinging,
rope-games, dice, dominoes, and dolls find some favour
as distractions.</p>

<p>If some little improvement has become noticeable in
educational matters under the enlightening influence of the
missionaries, great fault must be found with the condition
of the law. It is, of course, not always possible to graft
upon the legal procedure of one country a system of
administration which works well in another. Specific outbursts
of violence, arising from identical causes, assume
different complexions when considered from the point of
view of those who are proceeding to institute reforms. It
may be submitted, further, that a certain element of
barbarism in punishment is rendered necessary by the
conditions of some countries, imposing a restraint upon
a population which would scoff at punishment of a
more civilised description. If exception may be taken
to the penal code of Korea, it must be remembered that
in the Far East the quality of justice is not tempered with
mercy. Many punishments are still openly and frankly
barbarous, while others are distinguished by their exceptional<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
severity. Death by decapitation, mutilation, strangulation,
or poison is now less frequent than formerly.</p>

<p>Until within quite recent years it was the custom of
Korean law to make the family of the arch-criminal suffer
all his penalties with him. They are now exempted, and
with the reforms introduced during the movement in 1895,
some attempt was made to abolish practices opposed to the
spirit of progress. The table, which I append, shows the
punishments dispensed for certain crimes.</p>

<p>Under the Korean law, no wife can obtain a legal dissolution
of her marriage. The privilege of divorce rests with
the man; among the upper classes it is uncommon. The
wife, however, may leave her husband and accept the protection
of some relative, when, unless the husband can disprove
her charges, he has no redress. Should the wife fail
to establish her case against her husband, the cost of the
marriage ceremony, a large sum usually, is refunded by her
relatives. The law does not force a wife to cohabit with her
husband; nor, so far as it affects the woman, does it take
any cognisance of the matter. A man may divorce his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
retaining the custody of the children in every case, upon
statutory grounds, and upon the following additional counts:
indolence, neglect of the prescribed sacrifices, theft, and
shrewishness. There is no appeal against the charges of the
husband for women of the upper classes, domestic disturbances
being considered entirely reprehensible. Much greater
latitude prevails among the lower orders, irregular unions
of a most benign elasticity being preferred. Concubinage is
a recognised institution, and one in which the lower, as well
as the higher, classes indulge.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus38" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus38.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>JUSTICE IS NOT TEMPERED WITH MERCY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The rights of the children of concubines vary according
to the moral laxity of the class in which they are born.
Among the upper classes they possess no claim against the
estate of their progenitors; entail ignores them, and they
may not observe the family sacrifices. In the absence of
legitimate issue, a son must be adopted for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
inheriting the properties of the family and of attending to
the ancestral and funeral rites. Great stress is laid by the
upper classes upon purity of descent; among the middle
and lower orders there is more indulgence. Save in the
lowest classes, it is usual to maintain a separate establishment
for each concubine. The fact that among the lower
classes concubine and wife share the same house is responsible
for much of the unhappiness of Korean family
life. In every case the position of the children of concubines
corresponds with the status of the mother.</p>

<p>Within recent years, considerable changes have taken
place in the Government and in the administration of the
law. Under the old system the despotic thesis of divine
right was associated with many abuses. Justice was not
tempered by mercy, and, in the suppression of crime, it was
not always the guilty who suffered. The old system of
government was modelled upon the principles of the Ming
rule in China. The power of the sovereign was absolute
in theory and in practice. He was assisted by the
three principal officers of State and six administrative
boards, to whom, so soon as the country was brought into
contact with foreign nations, additional bureaux were added.
Modifications in the spirit, or in the letter of the law have
taken place from time to time at the instance of reformers.
Before the ascendency of the Japanese came about, the
principles and character of Korean law presented no very
marked deviation from that which had been upheld in China
through so many centuries. For a long time the intense
conservatism of China reigned in Korea. The authority of
the sovereign is more restricted to-day; but in the hands of
a less enlightened monarch it would be just as effective as
ever against the interests of the country. Happily, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
the era of progressive reform, which illustrated the inauguration
of the Empire, continues.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus39" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus39.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>CHILDREN OF THE LOWER CLASS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Government is now vested in a Council of State,
composed of a Chancellor, six Ministers, five Councillors,
and a Chief Secretary. The will of the sovereign is, however,
supreme. The Departments of State are conducted by
nine ministers, chief of whom is the Prime Minister, assisted
in his Cabinet by the President of the Privy Council, the
Ministers of the Household, of Foreign Affairs, Home
Affairs, Finance, War, Law, Education, and Agriculture.
With improved internal administration many of the abuses
which existed under the old system have disappeared.
There are still many grievances, and the working of the
new machine of State cannot be said to give unalloyed
satisfaction. Justice is still hedged about with bribery;
official corruptness admits of the venal purchase of office.
Much outcry accompanies the sweeping of the Augean
stables; and, at present, the advantages of the improvements
hardly justify the ecstatic jubilation by which their introduction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
was greeted. It is early yet to prophesy; but, if the
honourable administration of the public departments can be
obtained, there is no reason why success should not attend
the innovation. The responsibility for the working of the
administrative machine, however, rests, in the interval,
entirely upon the shoulders of the foreign advisers. It
remains to be seen, therefore, if the united services of these
distinguished people can prolong in any degree the era of
honest government in Korea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Farmers—Farming and farm animals—Domestic industries—Products—Quality
and character of food-stuffs</p>

</div>

<p>The Koreans are an agricultural people, and most of the
national industries are connected with agriculture. More
than seventy per cent. of the population are farmers; the
carpenter, the blacksmith, and the stonemason spring directly
from this class, combining a knowledge of the forge or workshop
with a life-long experience of husbandry. The schoolmaster
is usually the son of a yeoman-farmer; the fisherman
owns a small holding which his wife tills while he is
fishing. The farming classes participate in certain industries
of the country; the wives of the farmers raise the cotton,
silk, linen, and grass-cloth of the nation, and they also
convert the raw material into the finished fabrics. The
sandals, mats, osier and wooden wares which figure so
prominently in Korean households, are the work of the
farming classes in their leisure moments. The officials, the
<i>yamen</i> runners, the merchants, inn-keepers, miners, and
junk-men are not of this order, but they are often closely
connected with it. The Government exists on the revenue
raised from agriculture; the people live upon the fruits of the
soil; Korean officials govern whole communities given over
to agricultural labour. The internal economy of the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
has been affiliated for centuries to the pursuits and problems
of agriculture. Koreans are thus instinctively and intuitively
agriculturists, and it is necessarily along these lines that the
development of the country should in part progress.</p>

<p>It is impossible not to be impressed by a force which
works so laboriously, while it takes no rest save that variety
which comes with the change of season. The peaceable,
plodding farmer of Korea has his counterpart in his bull. The
Korean peasant and his weary bull are made for one another.
Without his ruminating partner, the work would be impracticable.
It drags the heavy plough through the deep mud
of the rice-fields, and over the rough surface of the grain
lands; it carries loads of brick and wood to the market,
and hauls the unwieldy market cart along the country roads.
The two make a magnificent pair; each is a beast of burden.
The brutishness, lack of intelligence, and boorishness of the
agricultural labourer in England is not quite reproduced in
the Korean. The Korean farmer has of necessity to force
himself to be patient. He is content to regard his sphere
of utility in this world as one in which man must labour
after the fashion of his animals, with no appreciable satisfaction
to himself.</p>

<p>Originally, if history speaks truly, the farmers of Korea
were inclined to be masterful and independent. Indications
of this earlier spirit are found nowadays in periodical protests
against the extortionate demands of local officials.
These disturbances are isolated and infrequent, for, when
once their spirits were crushed, the farmers developed
into the present mild and inoffensive type. They submit to
oppression and to the cruelty of the <i>Yamen</i>; they endure
every form of illegal taxation, and they ruin themselves to
pay “squeezes,” which exist only through their own humility.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
They dread the assumption of rank and the semblance
of authority. Their fear of a disturbance is so great that,
although they may murmur against the impositions of the
magistrate, they continue to meet his demands.</p>

<p>At the present day the farmer of Korea is the ideal child
of nature; superstitious, simple, patient and ignorant. He
is the slave of his work, and he moves no further from his
village than the nearest market. He has a terrified belief in
the existence of demons, spirits and dragons, whose dirty
and grotesque counterfeits adorn his thatched hut. There
are other characteristic traits in this great section of the
national life. Their capacity for work is unlimited; they
are seldom idle, and, unlike the mass of their countrymen,
they have no sense of repose. As farmers, they have
by instinct and tradition certain ideas and principles
which are excellent in themselves. To the wayfarer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
and stranger the individual farmer is supremely and surprisingly
hospitable. A foreigner discussing the peculiarities
of their scenery, their lands, and the general details of their
life with them, is struck by their profound reverence for
everything beyond their own understanding, and their
amazing sense of the beautiful in nature. The simplicity
of their appreciation is delightful. It is easy to believe
that they are more susceptible to the charms of flowers and
scenery than to that of woman.</p>

<p>At rare intervals the farmer indulges in a diversion.
Succumbing to the seductions of market day, after the
fashion of every other farmer the world has ever known,
he returns to the homestead a physical and moral wreck,
the drunk and disorderly residuum of many months of
dreary abstinence and respectability. At these times he
develops a phase of unexpected assertiveness, and forcibly
abducts some neighbouring beauty, or beats in the head of
a friend by way of enforcing his argument. From every
possible point of view he reveals qualities which proclaim
him the simple, if not ideal, child of nature.</p>

<p>During the many months of my stay in Korea I spent
some days at a wayside farmhouse, the sole accommodation
which could be obtained in a mountain village. The slight
insight into the mode of life of the farming peasant which
was thus gained was replete with interest, charm and
novelty. Knowing something of the vicissitudes of farm
life, I found the daily work of this small community
supremely instructive. Upon many occasions I watched
the farmer’s family and his neighbours at their work. The
implements of these people are rude and few, consisting of
a plough, with a movable iron shoe which turns the sods in
the reverse direction to our own; a spade, furnished with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
ropes and dragged by several men; bamboo flails and rakes,
and a small hoe, sharp and heavy, used as occasion may
require for reaping, chopping and hoeing, for the rough
work of the farm, or the lighter service of the house.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus41" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus41.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A SPADE FURNISHED WITH ROPES</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>During the harvest all available hands muster in the
fields. The women cut the crop, the men fasten the
sheaves, which the children load into rope panniers, suspended
upon wooden frames from the backs of bulls. The
harvest is threshed without delay, the men emptying the
laden baskets upon the open road, and setting to with
solemn and uninterrupted vigour. While the men threshed
with their flails, and the wind winnowed the grain, six, and
sometimes eight, women worked, with their feet, a massive
beam, from which an iron or granite pestle hung over a
deep granite mortar. This rough and ready contrivance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
pulverises the grain sufficiently for the coarse cakes which
serve in lieu of bread.</p>

<p>Beyond the bull and the pig, there are few farm animals
in the inland districts. The pony and the donkey are not
employed in agricultural work to the same extent as the
bull. This latter animal is
cared for more humanely
than the unfortunate pony,
whose good nature is
ruined by the execrable
harshness with which he
is treated. The gross cruelty
of the Korean to his pony
is the most loathsome feature
of the national life.</p>

<p>Irrigation is necessary
only for the rice, which
yields fairly abundant crops
throughout Central and
Southern Korea. To the
north, rice makes way for
millet, the great supplementary
food of Korea.
Elsewhere paddy-fields abound, and the people have become
adepts in the principles of irrigation and the art of conserving
water. Rice is sown in May, transplanted from
the nurseries to the paddy-fields in June, and gathered in
October. In times of drought, when it is necessary to tide
over the period of distress, the fields are used for barley,
oats and rye which, ripening in May and cut in June, allows
a supplementary crop to be taken from the fields. The
fields are then prepared for the rice. The land is inundated;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the peasant and his bull, knee-deep in water, plough
the patches. Beans, peas, and potatoes are planted between
the furrows of the cornfields, the land being made to produce
to its full capacity. The crops are usually excellent.</p>

<p>The fields differ from the farms in China, where the
farmers, preferring short
furrows, grow their crops
in small sections. The long
furrows of the Korean fields
recall Western methods,
but here the analogy ends.
The spectacle of these well-ordered
acres is a revelation
of the earnest way in which
these down-trodden people
combat adversity. In many
ways, however, they need
assistance and advice. If
it were prudent to accomplish
it, I would convert
the mission centres of the
inland districts into experimental
farm-stations, and
attach a competent demonstrator to each establishment.</p>

<p>The Koreans hold rice, their chief cereal, in peculiar
honour. They state that it originated in Ha-ram, in China,
at a period now involved in much fable and mystery—2838
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> to 2698 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The name, Syang-nong-si, itself means
Marvellous Agriculture. The name was doubtless given
at a later time. The first rice was brought to Korea by
Ki-ja in 1122 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> together with barley and other cereals.
Before that time the only grain raised in Korea was millet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
There are three kinds of rice in Korea, with a variety of
sub-species. First, that which is grown in the ordinary
paddy-fields. This is called specifically <i>tap-kok</i>, or paddy-field
rice. It is used almost exclusively to make pap,
the ordinary boiled rice. Then we have <i>chun-kok</i> or
field-rice. This is so-called upland rice. It is drier than
the paddy-field rice, and is used largely in making rice flour
and in brewing beer. The third kind is grown exclusively
on the slopes of mountains, and is a wild rice. It is
smaller and harder than the other kinds; for this reason
it is used to provision garrisons. It will withstand the
weather. Under favourable circumstances, lowland rice
will keep five years, but the mountain rice will remain
perfectly sound for quite ten years.</p>

<p>Next in importance to rice come the different kinds
of pulse, under which heading is included all the leguminous
plants, the bean and the pea family. That Korea is well
provided with this valuable and nutritious form of food will
be seen from the fact that there are thirteen species of round
beans, two kinds of long bean, and five varieties of mixed
bean. Of all these numerous assortments, the “horse-bean”
is by far the most common. It is the bean which
forms such a large part of the exports of Korea. It is supposed
by Koreans to have originated in North-Western China,
and derives its name from the fact that it is used very largely
for fodder. One variety only may be regarded as indigenous—the
black-bean—and it is found nowhere else in Eastern
Asia. Of the rest, the origin is doubtful. The horse-bean
grows in greatest abundance in Kyöng-syang Province and
on the island of Quelpart, though of course it is common all
over the country. The black-bean flourishes best in Chyöl-la
Province. The green-bean, oil-bean, and white-cap bean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
flourish in Kyöng-keui Province. The yellow bean is found
in Hwang-hai Province; the South River bean appears in
Chyung-chyöng Province; the grandfather-bean (so called
because of its wrinkles) grows anywhere, but not in large
quantities. The brown-bean and chestnut-bean come from
Kang-won Province.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to over-estimate the importance
of these different species of pulse to the Korean. They
furnish the oily and nitrogenous elements which are lacking
in rice. As a diet they are strengthening, the nutritious
properties of the soil imparting a tone to the system.
Preparations of beans are as numerous as the dishes made
from flour; it is impossible to enumerate them. Upon
an average, the Koreans eat about one-sixth as much pulse
as rice. The price of beans is one-half that of rice; the
price of either article is liable to variations. There are
varieties which cost nearly as much as rice.</p>

<p>The common name for barley is <i>po-ri</i>; in poetical parlance
the Koreans call barley The Fifth Moon of Autumn,
because it is then that it is harvested. The value of barley
to the Korean arises from the fact that it is the first grain to
germinate in the spring. It carries the people on until
the millet and rice crops are ready. Barley and wheat
are extensively raised throughout Korea for the purpose of
making wine and beer. In other ways, however, they
may be considered almost as important as the different
kinds of pulse. The uses of barley are very numerous.
Besides being used directly as farinaceous food it becomes
malt, medicine, candy, syrup, and furnishes a number of
side-dishes. Wheat comes mostly from Pyöng-an Province,
only small crops of it appearing in the other Provinces.
Barley yields spring and autumn crops, but wheat yields<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
only the winter crop. The poor accept wheat as a substitute
for rice, and brew a gruel from it. It is used as a paste; it
figures in the native pharmacopœia, and in the sacrifices
with which the summer solstice is celebrated.</p>

<p>Oats, millet, and sorghum are other important cereals in
Korea. There are six varieties of millet; the price of the
finer qualities is the same as that obtained for rice. One
only of these six varieties was found originally in the
country. Sorghum is grown principally in Kyöng-syang
Province. It grows freely, however, in the south; but is
less used than wheat, millet, or oats in Korea. A curious
distinction exists between the sorghum imported from
China and the native grain. In China, sorghum is used in
making sugar; when this sugar-producing grain arrives in
Korea it is found impossible to extract the sugar. Two of
the three kinds of sorghum in Korea are native, the third
coming from Central China. Oats become a staple food in
the more mountainous regions, where rice is never seen; it
is dressed like rice. From the stalk the Koreans make a
famous paper, which is used in the Palaces of the Emperor.
It is cultivated in Kang-won, Ham-kyöng, and Pyöng-an
Provinces.</p>

<p>The Korean is omnivorous. Birds of the air, beasts of
the field, and fish from the sea, nothing comes amiss to his
palate. Dog-meat is in great request at certain seasons;
pork and beef with the blood undrained from the carcase;
fowls and game—birds cooked with the lights, giblets, head
and claws intact, fish, sun-dried and highly malodorous, all
are acceptable to him. Cooking is not always necessary; a
species of small fish is preferred raw, dipped into some
piquant sauce. Other dainties are dried sea-weed, shrimps,
vermicelli, made by the women from buckwheat flour and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
white of egg, pine seeds, lily bulbs, honey-water, wheat,
barley, millet, rice, maize, wild potatoes, and all vegetables of
Western and Eastern gardens; even now the list is by no
means exhausted.</p>

<p>Their excesses make them martyrs to indigestion.</p>

<p>Southern
Korea bears
many evidences
of the warlike
activities and
commercial enterprise
of the
past generations
of Japanese,
who, abandoning
their own
island home,
sought domicile
upon the shores
of the neighbouring
peninsula.
The precarious
existence
of these waifs and strays from an alien state, in
the midst of a people whose whole attitude was anti-foreign,
did not deter others from coming to her ports.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
This gradual migration from Japan to the Hermit Kingdom
continued during many centuries, promoting an
intercourse between two races which the Government was
powerless to frustrate. Japanese historians argue from this
settlement in Korea that the State was a vassal of Japan
from the second century by right of conquest and appropriation.
The idea, which prevailed through seventeen
centuries, was not finally rejected until the Ambassador of
the Mikado signed a treaty at Seoul on February 7th, 1897,
which recognised Korea as an independent nation. From
about the beginning of the Christian era until the fifteenth
century, the relations between Japan and Korea were very
close. From this period onward Korea, although maintaining
her attitude of complacent indifference to events outside
her own Empire, betrayed signs of weakness in her policy
of isolation when menaced with the importunate demands
of her rival neighbours, China and Japan.</p>

<p>At the two points in her Empire adjacent to the dominions
of China and Japan, war and peace alternately prevailed.
If, upon occasion, the Koreans went out unsupported to
fight their invaders, the leaders more usually united with
one of the two rivals against the other. Thus, there was
always turmoil throughout the kingdom. In the south, as
in the north, the tide of war rolled backwards and forwards,
with varying success. From the west, the armies of China
appeared and vanished, skirting the Liao-tung Gulf, to
plunder and to devastate the peninsula. Fleets from Shantung,
crossing the Yellow Sea, dropped their anchors in
the rivers of the land. The west was threatened by the
hordes of China, and the south was harried by ships and
men from the east, who pounced upon Fusan and seized
the cities of the south. The aggressions of the Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
extinguished any hope the Koreans might still have cherished
of preserving the southern frontier of their kingdom intact.
Although cordons of armed sentinels and palisades, barriers
of mountains and miles of ruined and deserted wastes protected
the northern borders against the incursions of the
Chinese soldiers to some extent, the south was vulnerable.</p>

<p>Fusan was the floodgate through which poured the
hostile masses of Japan, an unbroken stream of men, to
deluge the land. They invaded Korea as enemies, levying
tribute; they came as allies against China; they appeared
as the embassies of a friendly State and returned enriched
to the Court of their Sovereign. Actuated by feelings of
mercy, they sent grain-ships to Fusan when famine overtook
their neighbours. Between Japan and Fusan there
was the continuous passing of ships. Around this outlet,
the one gate to the southern half of the kingdom, the
spasmodic beginnings of the present important commerce
between the two countries grew out of a fretful exchange of
commodities.</p>

<p>In the years that followed the earlier visitations, Japan
became so embarrassed by her own internal troubles, that
the Kingdom of Korea was left in that peace and seclusion
which, always preferring, it had found so much difficulty
in securing. This happy state of things prevailed for two
centuries. At the end of this interval, the annual embassy
to Japan from the Court of Korea had ceased. The kingdom
in general, lulled by visions of perpetual peace, no longer
maintained defences. Military preparations were neglected;
the army was disorganised; the old fighting spirit of the
people died down, and martial exercises disappeared from
the training of the militia. Dissipation and profligacy were
rife. In the meantime, order having been restored in Japan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the thoughts of her soldiers again turned towards fields
of conquest and deeds of daring. The vassalship of Korea
was recalled; the King was summoned to renew his
allegiance. The answer proving unsatisfactory, preparations
for an invasion were at once begun. The fleet
assembled and the ships set sail. The mobility which was
to distinguish the Japanese in after years characterised
their movements in this campaign. Within eighteen days
after their landing at Fusan, the capture of the capital was
accomplished and a blow was struck, which enabled the
Koreans at last to understand the gravity of their plight.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus45" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus45.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE GUARD OF THE JAPANESE LEGATION, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The part, which Fusan played in this war, materially
assisted the invading hosts of Japan. A settlement at Fusan,
which had been founded long since by the retainers of the
Daimio of the island of Tsu-shima, assisted by itinerant
traders and deserters from the numerous expeditions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
visited its shores, had grown to such dimensions that when
the force was descried off the harbour upon the morning of
May 25th, 1592, Fusan was already in their possession.
This circumstance gave the troops immediate facilities for
disembarkation, and, in the subsequent vicissitudes of the
next six years’ campaign, expedited the progress of the war.
The position of Fusan speedily made the place a base
of supplies to the army of operation and a repairing yard
for the Japanese fleet after their disastrous engagement
with the Korean ships, in an attempt to co-operate with the
victorious forces, which Konishi and Kuroda had assembled
before Pyöng-yang. After the conclusion of the first invasion
and the Japanese retreat from the north, before the combined
strength of the Chinese and Koreans on May 22nd,
1593, Fusan became one of the fortified camps upon
the coast, where the Japanese armies passed the winter
in sight of the shores of their own land. The negotiations,
which were opened in the following year, and
shifted alternately between the camp of the Commander-in-Chief
at Fusan and the Courts in China and Japan,
failed.</p>

<p>Even at this date Japan was anxious to establish her
power in Korea by obtaining possession of the southern
provinces. Foiled in this attempt, she renewed her attack.
Fusan again became the seat of the councils of war, and
the base for the second invasion. The operations began
with the siege of the Castle of Nan-on, in Chyöl-la province,
upon the morning of September 21st, 1597. Twelve months
later, the Japanese were withdrawn from Korea, and the
war came to its close. Two hundred years passed before
Korea recovered from the desolation of this conflict, which
was one in which the loss of three hundred thousand men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
was recorded. Moreover, the Japanese retained Fusan, a
perpetual evidence of their victory.</p>

<p>This early claim to the southern provinces put forward
by the Japanese plainly reveals how long standing is their
wish to annex the southern half of Korea. Even in modern
times, they have embarked upon one campaign in the
interests of Korea, while they are now ready to go to war with
Russia on behalf of the same nation that they themselves
consistently bully. Their plea of Korea for the Koreans,
however, is in curious contrast to their own lawless domination
of the coveted territory. Indeed, the interests which
the Japanese have developed for themselves throughout
these regions do not disclose much consideration for the
rights of the natives. The treaty of 1876, which opened
Fusan to Japanese settlers, removed the nominal obstacles
to that over-sea immigration which had been progressing
steadily during several centuries. A wave of Japanese
colonisation at once lapped the eastern, western, and
southern shores of the Hermit Kingdom.</p>

<p>Indications of previous incursions were given by the
affinity which existed between the language, manners, and
local customs of these newcomers and the indigenous race.
The existence of this affinity became a powerful, if impersonal,
instrument in abating the opposition of the population
to the settlement. Unable to obtain the secession of
the territory which they so much desired, communities of
Japanese fringed its borders. They planted themselves
wherever there were prospects of trade, until the resources
of the land were tapped in all directions, and the control of
its commerce was virtually in their hands. As other ports
were opened at the persistent instigation of these persevering
traders, however, the settlement of the south<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
proceeded less rapidly. In view of the changing relations
between Korea and the Powers, therefore, the
Japanese passed further afield, developing some little
industry to their own advantage wherever they went.
Trade followed their flag, whether they were within the
radius of the treaty ports, or engaged in forcing the
hand of the local officials by settling beyond the limitations
of their Conventions. The success of these efforts was soon
assured. Despite the stipulations of the treaties, and in
face of the objections of their own, as well as the Korean,
Government, the irrepressible activity of these pioneers of a
past generation unconsciously contributed to that supremacy
which the trade of Japan has since achieved in the
land of her former enemy.</p>

<p>The expansion of Japanese interests in Korea has not
been without political design. The integrity of her neighbour
is bound up with her own existence. The security of
Korea emphasises the safety of her own borders; and, as
her own Empire has developed into a first-class Power, this
desire to see the kingdom respected has become more and
more the spirit of the policy upon which she has concentrated
her individual action. She has fostered the trade
with Korea because it drew together the ties which connected
the two countries. She has urged the concession
of ports, and still more ports, to foreign commerce, because
the preponderance of her trade in these open marts substantiates
her claim to be the lawful champion of the race.
The progress of Korea, since the country came under her
supervision, has been more evident than any of the
difficulties which have originated out of the disposition of
the Japanese to bully and coerce the Koreans. If, upon
occasion, the results have suggested that the blind cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
lead the blind without disaster, the rarity of mistakes
reflects credit upon the judgment which has been displayed.
This combination is, of course, directed against
foreigners. Just as Japan is discarding those Western
teachers, whose genius and administrative abilities protected
her in her days of ignorance, so does she hanker after the
time when she alone may guard the interests of Korea, and
supply the demands of her markets. At present, however,
it is open to question whether the Koreans will have overcome
their feelings of irritation against the Japanese by the
time that these have become thoroughly progressive in
their treatment of the Koreans. The Japanese are more
repressive in their methods than they need be.</p>

<p>The extraneous evidence of the power of the Japanese
irritates the Koreans, increasing the unconquerable aversion
which has inspired them against the Japanese through
centuries, until, of the various races of foreigners in Korea
at the present, none are so deservedly detested as those
hailing from the Island Empire of the Mikado. Nor is
this prejudice remarkable, when it is considered that it is
the scum of the Japanese nation that has settled down upon
Korea. It is, perhaps, surprising that the animus of the
Koreans against the Japanese has not died out with time; but
the fault lies entirely with the Japanese themselves. Within
recent years so much has occurred to alter the position of
Japan and to flatter the vanity of these island people that
they have lost their sense of perspective. Puffed up with
conceit, they now permit themselves to commit social and
administrative excesses of the most detestable character.
Their extravagant arrogance blinds them to the absurdities
and follies of their actions, making manifest the fact that
their gloss of civilisation is the merest veneer. Their conduct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
in Korea shows them to be destitute of moral and
intellectual fibre. They are debauched in business, and the
prevalence of dishonourable practices in public life makes
them indifferent to private virtue. Their interpretation of
the laws of their settlements, as of their own country, is
corrupt. Might is right; the sense of power is tempered
neither by reason, justice nor generosity. Their existence
from day to day, their habits and their manners, their
commercial and social degradation, complete an abominable
travesty of the civilisation which they profess to have
studied. It is intolerable that a Government aspiring to the
dignity of a first-class Power should allow its settlements in
a friendly and foreign country to be a blot upon its own
prestige, and a disgrace to the land that harbours them.</p>

<p>There are some twenty-five thousand Japanese in Korea,
and the Japanese settlement is the curse of every treaty port
in Korea. It is at once the centre of business, and the scene
of uproar, riot, and confusion. In the comparative nakedness
of the women, in the noise and violence of the shopkeepers,
in the litter of the streets, there is nothing to
suggest the delicate culture of Japan. The modesty,
cleanliness, and politeness, so characteristic of the Japanese,
are conspicuously absent in their settlements in this country.
Transformation has taken place with transmigration. The
merchant has become a rowdy; the coolie is impudent,
violent, and, in general, an outcast more prone to
steal than to work. Master and man alike terrorise the
Koreans, who go in fear of their lives whenever they
have transactions with the Japanese. Before the Chino-Japanese
war this spirit had not displayed itself to any
great extent in the capital of the Hermit Kingdom.
With the successful conclusion of that campaign, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
the Japanese became so aggressive in their treatment
of the people that, had the choice of two evils been
possible in view of these events, the Koreans would have
preferred the Chinese and a state of dependence to the
conditions which were then introduced. The universal
admiration aroused by the conduct of the Japanese troops
in the North-China campaign of 1900-1901 has added
sensibly to the vanity and egoism of these Korean-Japanese.
Convinced of their innate superiority, their
violence towards the Koreans goes on unchecked. It
threatens now to assume unparalleled dimensions. If the
relations between the Powers are to continue upon a
satisfactory footing in Korea, it will be necessary for the
Japanese Government to redress those abuses which
foreigners, Japanese, and Koreans alike have combined to
denounce.</p>

<p>The commercial prospects of Korea—Openings to trade—Requirements
of markets—Lack of British enterprise</p>

</div>

<p>The trade returns for 1900 exceeded every previous year.
During the period covered by the Boxer disturbances,
however, the Korean exports to China decreased, and the
importation of foreign goods likewise fell off. The stimulus
given to the cereal trade, by the interruption of the Manchurian
export bean trade from Newchang, and by the
demand for food-supplies for the troops in China, more
than counterbalanced this temporary decline in direct native
exports and direct foreign imports. Cotton goods, however,
show an increase of £14,297 over the figures of previous
years; but there is a specific falling off in imports of British
manufacture and origin, and a specific advance in the more
important lines of Japanese goods. I append a small table
revealing the comparative prosperity of British and Japanese
trade at this date:</p>

<p>In time, the markets of Japan will produce everything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
which at present comes from America in the shape of canned
goods, and from Europe, in the form of textiles or food-stuffs.
Japanese woven fabrics, and canned foods of inferior quality
are driving the wholesale manufacturing houses of England
and America from the markets. At present, therefore, the
trade of Korea is limited as much by the capacity of the
Japanese markets as by the wants of the Korean. In face
of the opposition of the Japanese, their determination to
retain the Korean markets for themselves, and the absence
of effective attempts by Western houses to beat up such
trade as may exist, it is difficult to believe that the future
will show any material expansion in the capacity of the
foreign trade.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Korea provides a fair field for capital. It
would be quite possible to improve the condition of foreign
trade, if merchants could arrange to protect their interests
by establishing their own agencies in the country, under
competent and energetic European management. When
British merchants depart from their apathetic indifference
and organise an exhaustive expert inquiry into the capabilities
of the Korean trade, their trouble will be quickly
rewarded. New markets require new commodities, the
demand for which any technical inspection of the requirements
of the people will disclose. Until this examination
takes place, however, the stagnation in British trade must
continue. Korea offers to British interests an interesting
field in which the development of new industries must be
conducted upon practical lines. Briefly, the imports in
demand are those which are necessary to meet the requirements
of an agricultural country whose mining resources
are in process of development and whose railway system is
as yet in its early stages. The increase in the importation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of mining supplies supports this contention. Bags and
ropes for packing, machinery for agricultural and mining
purposes, and sewing machines are in greater demand.
Railway material is, of course, wanted. The new industries
may not be upon a large scale. Primitive methods doubtless
will continue for the most part to govern native manufactures
such as grass cloth, straw mats, ropes, &amp;c. Excellent
paper has been made since the replacement of the use of
native lye by caustic soda and soda-ash, while the innovation
is one to which the people have taken kindly enough.
Again, while the paper industry is capable of expansion,
a brisk business in leather could be built up in the country.
Hides, which are exported to Japan in their raw state,
are abundant, and might be converted into leather so
easily on the spot. The straw braid industry contains great
possibilities, while the climate of Korea is naturally suited
to the growth and treatment of silk.</p>

<p>Many things would be necessary to the success of
such enterprises. The work must be based upon a
knowledge of the country and its language. The
manufacturer or the merchant must take the pains to
accommodate a direct import trade to the exigencies
of the local market. As an example, smaller bales and
shorter lengths are requisite in the piece goods. The
establishment of sample warehouses at the treaty ports,
and in the more important trade-centres of the interior,
where bales of shirting, cotton and woollen goods, cases
of farming implements, &amp;c., could be opened and sold
for cash, would appeal to the natives. This departure
would avoid the increase in the prime cost of the articles
necessitated by the existing system of transhipment.
At present, goods come from Shanghai to Chi-fu and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
thence to Chemulpo. They pass then from the importer
to the Chinese merchants, and from them to the Korean
wholesale buyers; these resell them in greatly diminished
quantities to the pedlars and agents, who retail the goods.
It would also be advisable to create consular agencies
in Fusan and Won-san. Official representation at present
is confined to an underpaid and understaffed Legation
in Seoul, and a vice-consulate in Chemulpo. Additional
<i>employés</i> should be interchangeable, undertaking either
the vice-consular duties of the ports or the secretarial
services of the Legation.</p>

<p>The bulk of the imports and exports, which pass through
the Customs, comes from China and Japan. The means of
transport are controlled by Japanese; the export trade of
the country is entirely in their hands. This fact alone should
appeal to British shipping interests and to ship-owners.
Unfortunately, many years of prosperity have brought
about great changes in the spirit of our nation, and we
no longer show the enterprise and initiative which formerly
distinguished us. This depreciation in the forces of the
nation has promoted a corresponding depression in our
trade. We are no longer the pioneers of commerce; nor
have we the capacity and courage of our forefathers who
fostered those interests of which we are now so neglectful
in every quarter of the globe. At the dawn of the twentieth
century, it is amazing to find a country, with a total foreign
import and export trade exceeding two millions and a half
sterling for the year 1901 and two millions and three quarters
sterling for the year 1902, whose shores were visited by over
ten thousand steam and sailing trading-vessels in the same
period, registering an aggregate tonnage of more than two
million tons, almost untouched by British merchantmen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
Deplorable as this may be, statistics which Mr. McLeavy
Brown has drawn up show that one steamship, chartered by
Chinese and floating the British flag, entered Korean waters
in 1900; that four steamers came in each of the years 1901-2,
a return which reveals a steady decline upon the previous
years. Since Korea was opened to trade in 1880, British
shipping has visited the country in the proportion of 1377
tons to every two years. Despite appeals from our Consuls
in Korea to British steamship companies improvement has
been impossible; since no response was evoked by their
efforts, and no service has been established. The consequence
of this is that a valuable opportunity has been
allowed to escape, the Japanese profiting by our indifference.</p>

<p>The trade of Korea is increasing gradually. A steamer,
which could make periodical calls between Shanghai and
Won-san, Yokohama and Vladivostock, taking cargo and
passengers to the open ports of Korea, and touching at
Japan upon the journey back, would return good money
upon the venture. British and Chinese merchants would
prefer to ship in a British vessel. The old-fashioned
traditions of the British mercantile service, as to punctuality
and despatch, are not carried out by the steamers of the
Nippon Yusen Kaisha and the Osaka Shosen Kaisha,
which call at the ports in Korea. It is almost impossible
to know when the steamers of these companies will arrive
or when they will leave. Little attempt is made to observe
their schedule. The condition of the vessels of
the latter company accredited to the Korean run is
filthy. Moreover, this company is careless of cargo,
and quite indifferent to the comforts of its passengers.
The Nippon Yusen Kaisha certainly supplies meals in
foreign style, but the Osaka Shosen Kaisha provides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
nothing. Plying between Japan, China and Korea, this
company declines to make any arrangements for foreigners
in the matter of food or accommodation. One experience
is enough. Unfortunately, foreigners are compelled to travel
in them, as the steamers of one or other of the two companies
are usually the sole means of communication between
those countries and Korea. There is cargo and passenger
traffic for any company that will organise a regular steam-service.
The profits might be small at first, since the Japanese
prefer to endure their own steamers and to ship under their
own flag; but there are signs that the flourishing condition
of the trade of the country would bring ultimate success.</p>

<p>The establishment of a steamer-service, if only of one or
two steamers, is not the sole hazard by which Japanese
competition might be faced. The climate of Korea is
peculiarly suited to fruit-culture. If this work were taken
in hand, the fruit might be tinned or exported fresh to
China, where it would find a ready sale. The fertility of the
soil near Won-san and the abundance of fish in the sea off
that part of the coast, would make that port a suitable
export centre for the creation of a fish and fruit-canning
industry under foreign management. Fish and fruit industries
of this description in Japan are profitable and very bad.
Nevertheless, their output is widely distributed over the Far
East. The initiation of these industrial ventures would
require some time, for many difficulties oppress foreigners,
who are anxious to put capital into Korea. In the end,
a modest venture would reap sufficient success to justify
the speculation, while the returns would probably permit
an immediate expansion of the enterprise. There is no
doubt about the fish; there is no doubt about the fruit;
but whatever investment of an industrial character is made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
in Korea, close and high-class technical supervision is the
necessary accompaniment.</p>

<p>The British merchant in the Far East is the first to
condemn his own Minister and to abuse his own Consul,
and he is the very last to help himself. It may be, however,
that the follies of the Imperial Government, the unreasoning
prejudices and foolish blundering of the Foreign Office, have
created this apathy. The drifting and vacuous policy of Lord
Salisbury made it impossible to avert the decay of our prestige
and trade which has set in throughout the Far East. Official
returns establish only too completely the unhappy predicament
in which trade and merchants alike are placed. There
is a general decrease in the volume of the one, and there
has been no sympathetic activity among those engaged in
commercial interests elsewhere to set against it. The
deficiency is almost without solution, so long as bounty-fed
manufactures, carried in subsidised bottoms, are set
against the products of an unassisted trade. Competition is
increasing, and foreign manufacturers are themselves now
meeting the requirements of the markets of China. There
is little prospect in the future of the restoration of our
former commercial superiority. Much might be attempted,
although it seems almost as if the British merchant were so
bent upon his own damnation, that little could be done.</p>

<p>The decline of British trade cannot be attributed in any
way to the late disturbances in North China, to the
decline in the purchasing power of the dollar, or to the
temporary rise in the market prices. Japan has become our
most formidable competitor. The decrease in our trade is
due entirely to the commercial development and rise of
Japan, who, together with America, has successfully taken
from us markets in which, prior to their appearance, British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
goods were supreme. The gravity of the situation in which
British trade is placed cannot be lightly regarded. We still
lay claim to the carrying trade of the Far East; but the
figures, which support our pre-eminence in this direction are
totally unreliable. If the true conditions were made manifest,
it would be seen that so far from leading the shipping of
the world in the Far East, Great Britain could claim but a
small proportion of the freights carried. Although we may
own the ships, neither our markets nor our manufactures are
associated with their cargoes. It would be well if the public
could grasp this feature of the China trade. Members of
Parliament, ignorant of the deductions which are necessary
before claiming the carrying trade of the Far East—much
less of the Yang-tse and of the China coast—as an asset in
our commercial prosperity, and a sign of vigour of the first
magnitude, do not recognise how unsubstantial is the
travesty of affluence which they so constantly applaud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>During 1901, owing to the Boxer disturbance, large
numbers of ships owned by natives were transferred to the
British flag. The ostensible decrease in the tonnage of
British vessels, which entered and cleared affected ports, was
therefore less than that of other nationalities. Similarly,
there was a small increase in the duties paid under the
British flag during the same period, owing to the valuable
character of these cargoes. Under ordinary circumstances,
the comparatively small decrease in the British tonnage and
the increase of more than fifty thousand taels in the payments
made to the Imperial Customs at such a moment of
unrest, would suggest the stability of our trading interest,
and afford no mean standard by which to judge the capacity
of the markets. Unfortunately, the two most important
counts in the returns, tonnage and duties, are no criterion.
It is necessary to inspect closely the individual values of the
different articles comprising the total trade. In this way
the general depreciation of our manufactures is at once
apparent.</p>

<p>A comparison of the American, Japanese, and German
returns shows which are the commercial activities that are
threatening our existence as a factor in the markets of the
Far East. If, in the returns, we were shown the relations
between the duties paid under each flag, and the tonnage of
any particular country, besides the source and destination
of its cargo, the true condition of British trade would
be revealed at a glance. As it is, until a table is added to
the Maritime Report, which will supply this valuable and
interesting demonstration, the system of a separate examination
is alone to be relied upon. By this method we find
that between the years 1891 and 1901 there was a consistent
falling-off in British exports to the Far East in almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
every commodity in which the competition of America,
Japan, and Germany was possible. Since 1895, when Japan
began to assert herself in the markets of China, those
articles which, pre-eminently among the commercial
Powers, she can herself supply, have carried everything
before them. Ten years ago the British trade in cloths,
drills, shirtings, cottons, yarns, and matches had attained
magnificent dimensions. In certain particulars, only, our
trade was rivalled by the United States of America, whose
propinquity gave to them some little advantage in the
markets of the Far East. Now, however, the trade has
passed altogether into the hands of the Japanese, or is so
equally divided between Japan and America, Japan and
Germany, that our pristine supremacy has disappeared.</p>

<p>British, American, Japanese, French, German, and Belgian
interests—Railways and mining fictions—Tabled counterfeited
Imports</p>

</div>

<p>With the exception of Great Britain, the example of the
Japanese in Korea has stirred the Western Powers to
corresponding activity. Every strange face in Seoul
creates a crop of rumours. Until the new-comer proves
himself nothing more dangerous than a correspondent,
there is quite a flutter in the Ministerial dove-cots. Speculation
is rife as to his chance of securing the particular
concession after which, of course, it is well known he has
come from Europe, Asia, Africa, or America. The first
place among the holders of concessions is very evenly
divided between Japan and America. If the interests of
Japan be placed apart, those of America are certainly the
most prominent. Germany and Russia are busily creating
opportunities for the development of their relations with the
industries of the country; Italy and Belgium have secured
a footing; Great Britain is alone in the indifference with
which she regards the markets of Korea.</p>

<p>In this chapter I propose to state briefly the exact
position occupied in Korea by the manufacturing and
industrial interests of foreign countries; adding a specific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
table, which, I hope, may attract the attention of British
manufacturers to the means by which the Japanese houses
contrive to meet the demands of the Korean market. The
competition of the Japanese has an advantage in the propinquity
of their own manufacturing centres; a co-operative
movement throughout the Japanese settlements against
foreign goods is another factor in their supremacy.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, afford British manufacturers some small
consolation to know that there are still many articles which
defy the imitative faculties of the Japanese. These are,
mainly, the products of the Manchester market, which have
proved themselves superior to anything which can be placed
in competition against them. It has been found, for instance,
impossible to imitate Manchester dyed goods, nor
can Japanese competition affect the popularity of this
particular line. Chinese grass-cloths have, however, cut
out Victoria lawns fairly on their merits. The Chinese
manufacturer, unhampered by any rise in the cost of production
and transportation, produces a superior fabric, of
more enduring quality, at a lower price. Moreover, in spite
of the assumed superiority of American over English locomotives,
on the Japanese railways in Korea the rolling
stock produced by British manufacturers has maintained
its position. It is pleasing to learn that some proportion
of the equipment of the old line from Chemulpo
to Seoul, and of the new extension to Fusan, have
been procured from England. Mr. Bennett, the manager
of Messrs. Holme Ringer and Company, the one British
house in Korea, with whom the order from the Japanese
company was placed, informed me that the steel rails and
fish-plates imported would be from Cammel and Company,
the wheels and axles from Vickers, and that orders for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
number of corrugated iron goods sheds had been placed
in Wolverhampton. The locomotives were coming from
Sheffield. The Japanese company expressly stipulated that
the materials should be of British make; it was only through
the extreme dilatoriness of certain British firms in forwarding
catalogues and estimates, that an order, covering a large
consignment of iron wire, nails, and galvanised steel telegraph
wire, was placed in America. This dilatoriness
operates with the most fatal effect upon the success of
British industries. The Emperor of Korea instructed
Mr. Bennett to order forty complete telephones, switch-boards,
key-boards, and instruments, all intact. Ericson’s, of
Stockholm, despatched triplicate cable quotations, forwarding
by express shipment triplicate catalogues and photographs,
as well as cases containing models of their different
styles, with samples of wet and dry cables. One of the two
British firms, to whom the order had been submitted, made
no reply. The other, after an interval of two months, dictated
a letter of inquiry as to the chemical qualities of the soil,
and the character of the climatic influences to which the
wires, switch-boards, and instruments would be subjected!</p>

<p>A few years ago a demand arose for cheap needles and
fish-hooks. The attention of British manufacturers was
drawn to the necessity of supplying a needle which could be
bent to the shape of a fish-hook. A German manufacturer
got wind of the confidential circular which Mr. Bennett had
prepared, and forwarded a large assortment of needles and
fish-hooks, the needles meeting the specified requirements.
The result of this enterprise was that the German firm
skimmed the cream of the market. The English needles
were so stiff that they snapped at once; and it is perhaps
unnecessary to add that, beyond the few packets opened for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
the preliminary examination, not one single order for these
needles has been taken.</p>

<p>The position which Great Britain fills in Korea is destitute
of any great commercial or political significance. Unintelligible
inaction characterises British policy there—as
elsewhere. Our sole concession is one of very doubtful
value, relating to a gold mine at Eun-san. In the
latter part of 1900 a company was formed in London,
under the style of the British and Korean Corporation,
to acquire the Pritchard Morgan Mining Concession
from the original syndicate. In the spring of 1901 Mr. E. T.
McCarthy took possession of the property on behalf of the
new owners. Mr. McCarthy had had considerable experience
as a mine manager. The most careful management was
necessary to the success of this concern. The expenses of
working were extraordinarily heavy, as, owing to the absence
of fuel, coal had to be imported from Japan. A coal seam
had been located upon the concession, but nothing was then
known as to its suitability for steam purposes. It is impossible
to consider the undertaking very seriously. All
surface work was stopped during my residence in Korea,
the operations for the past few months having been confined
to underground development and prospecting. There was
talk of the instalment of a mill. A vein of pyrrhotine,
carrying copper for a width of 13 ft., was regarded with some
interest, but in the absence of machinery nothing of much
consequence could be done.</p>

<p>Another concern, Anglo-Chinese in its formation, is the
Oriental Cigarette and Tobacco Company, Limited. The
capital of this venture is registered from Hong-Kong.
Since May 1902, the company has been engaged at
Chemulpo in the manufacture, from Richmond and Korean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
tobacco, of cigarettes of three kinds. At the present time it
possesses machinery capable of a daily output of one million
cigarettes. In the days of its infancy, the company was
reduced to a somewhat precarious existence—the early
weeks of its career producing no returns whatsoever. Now,
however, a brighter period has dawned, and an ultimate
prosperity is not uncertain. Cash transactions, in the sales
of the cigarettes manufactured by the company, began in
July 1902, realising by the end of February 1903, £1515
sterling; to this must be added credit sales of £896
sterling—making a grand total for the first few months of
its existence of £2411 sterling. A large staff of native
workers is permanently employed.</p>

<p>Aside from this company and the mining corporation,
British industrial activity is confined almost exclusively to
the agency which Mr. Bennett so ably controls in Chemulpo,
of which a branch is now established in the capital,
and the Station Hotel which Mr. Emberley conducts at
Seoul. Mr. Jordan, the British Minister in Korea, did
request in June 1903, a concession for a gold mine five
miles square in Hwang-hai Province. Apart from this, the
apathy of the British merchant cannot be regarded as singular
when business houses in London direct catalogues, intended
for delivery at Chemulpo, to the British Vice-Consul, Korea,
Africa. Nor, by the way, is Korea a part of China. Mr.
Emberley has established a comfortable and very prosperous
hotel in the capital, while at Chemulpo Mr. Bennett
has opened out whatever British trade exists in Korea.
British interests are safe enough in his hands, and if
merchants will act in co-operation with him, it might still
be possible to create good business, in spite of the competition
and imitation of the Japanese. In this respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
British traders are not unreasonably expected to observe the
custom, prevailing among all Chinese merchants, of giving
Korean firms an extended credit. Foreign banks in the Far
East charge seven or eight per cent., per annum, and the
native banks ten to fourteen per cent., which represents
a very considerable advance upon home rates. In the
opinion of Mr. Bennett, who is, without doubt, one of the
most astute business men in the Far East, no little improvement
would be shown in the Customs return of British
imports, if the manufacturers at home would ship goods to
Korea on consignment to firms, whose standing and bank
guarantees were above suspicion, charging thereon only
home rates of interest. An American company, engaged
extensively in business with Korea, never draws against
shipments, by that means deriving considerable advantage
over its competitors. I commend this suggestion to the
attention of the British shipper, particularly as trade in
Korea is largely dependent upon the rice crop. In the train
of a bad harvest comes a reduction of prices. Importers,
then, who have ordered stocks beforehand, find themselves
placed in a quandary. Their stocks are left upon their
hands—it may be for a year, or even longer—and they are
confronted with the necessity of meeting the excessive rates
of interest current in the Far East. If the manufacturer
could meet the merchant by allowing a rate of interest,
similar to that prevailing at home, to be charged, the importer
of British goods would be less disinclined to indent
ahead. Under existing circumstances the merchant must
take the risk of ordering in the spring for autumn delivery,
and <i>vice-versâ</i>; on the other hand, China and Japan, being
within a few days’ distance of Korea, the importer prefers to
await the fulfilment of the rice crop, when, as occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
requires, he can cable to Shanghai, Osaka, or elsewhere
for whatever may be desired.</p>

<p>Attached to the English Colony in Korea, which
numbers one hundred and forty-one, there is the usual
complement of clergy and nursing sisters, under the
supervision of Bishop Corfe, the chief of the English
Mission in Seoul. Miss Cooke, a distinguished lady doctor
and a kind friend to the British Colony, is settled in
Seoul. A number of Englishmen are employed in the
Korean Customs; their services contributing so much to
the splendid institution which Mr. McLeavy Brown has
created, that one and all are above criticism. Mr. McLeavy
Brown would be the first to acknowledge how much the
willing assistance of his staff has contributed to his success.</p>

<p>The importance of the American trade in Korea is undeniable.
It is composite in its character, carefully considered,
protected by the influence of the Minister, supported
by the energies of the American missionaries, and controlled
by two firms, whose knowledge of the wants of Korea is
just forty-eight hours ahead of the realisation of that want
by the Korean. This is, I take it, just as things should be.
The signs of American activity, in the capital alone, are
evident upon every side. The Seoul Electric Car Company,
the Seoul Electric Light Company, and the Seoul (Fresh
Spring) Water Company have been created by American
enterprise, backed up by the “liveness” and ’cuteness of the
two concessionaires, whom I have just mentioned, and
pushed along by little diplomatic attentions upon the part
of the American Minister. The Seoul-Chemulpo Railway
Concession was also secured by an American, Mr. Morse,
the agent of the American Trading Company, and subsequently
sold to the Japanese company in whom the rights<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
of the concession are now vested. The charter of the
National Bank of Korea has also been awarded to these
Americans, and it is now in process of creation. The only
mine in Korea which pays is owned by an American syndicate;
and, by the way, Dr. Allen, the American Minister,
possesses an intelligible comprehension of the Korean
tongue.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus48" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus48.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE CONSULTING-ROOM OF MISS COOKE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a large American colony in Korea, totalling in
all two hundred and forty. One hundred live in Seoul;
sixty-live are employed upon the American Mine at Un-san;
thirty-four live at Pyöng-yang. Five are in the service of the
Korean Government; ten are associated with the railway;
the famous two are engaged in business and the remainder
comprise the staffs of the Legation and Consulate, and
a medley of missionaries. American trade with Korea
embraces kerosene, flour, mining machinery, railway and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
mining supplies, household goods and agricultural implements,
clothing and provisions, drills, sheetings, cotton
goods, and cotton yarn. The American mine at Un-san
employs seventeen Japanese and one hundred and thirty-three
Chinese, one hundred Europeans, of whom thirty-five
are American, and four thousand natives, whose wages range
from 8<i>d.</i> to 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> daily. The private company that has
acquired this concession works five separate mines with
enormous success; four mills, two of forty stamps and two
of twenty stamps, are of long standing. An additional mill
of eighty stamps is of more recent construction. During 1901
gold to the amount of £150,000 was exported by the company,
while in the year following this sum was very vastly
exceeded. The area of the concession is eight hundred
square miles.</p>

<p>The future alone can disclose whether Korea is to be
absorbed by the Japanese. At present, the Japanese
population in Korea exceeds twenty thousand, the actual
estimate falling short of twenty-five thousand. The Japanese
control the railway between Chemulpo and Seoul, as
well as the important trunk line to Fusan, an undertaking
now in course of construction and under the
immediate supervision of the Japanese Government. The
new company has since absorbed the parent line from
Seoul to Chemulpo. The capital of this company is
twenty-five million yen, £2,500,000, which is to be raised
in annual instalments of five million yen, counting from the
time when one-tenth of the first instalment of five million yen
was found. As a matter of fact, the preliminary turning
of the first sods took place at Fusan on September 21st, and
at Yong-tong-po on August 20th, in the summer of 1901.
From that moment, the Japanese Government made itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
responsible for the payment of the debenture bonds, and
guaranteed six per cent. upon the company’s subscribed
capital for a period of fifteen years.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Each share is of the
value of £5, the money to be called up as required, each
call being at the rate of ten shillings per share. The whole
of the 400,000 shares, which was the original allotment,
was at once taken up, Japanese and Koreans alone being
eligible as shareholders. The estimated cost of the line is
£9000 per mile. Work has been completed as far as
Syu-won, a distance of twenty-six miles, over which
section trains are already running. Construction is, of
course, being rapidly pushed forward, and working parties
are engaged at a number of places along the line of route.</p>

<p>The length of the Seoul-Fusan Railway will be
287 miles. It is confidently expected that the undertaking
will be completed within six years. There will
be some forty stations, including the terminal depôts,
and it is, perhaps optimistically, estimated that the
scheduled time for the journey from Fusan to Seoul will
be twelve hours, which is an average of twenty-four miles
an hour, including stops, the actual rate of speed being
approximately some thirty miles an hour. The present
working speed of the Seoul-Chemulpo railway requires a
little less than two hours to make the journey between
Seoul and Chemulpo, a distance of twenty-five miles, from
which it will be seen that considerable improvement must
take place if the distance between Seoul and Fusan is to be
accomplished within twelve hours.</p>

<p>In the first few miles of the journey, the trunk line to
Fusan will run over the metals of the Seoul-Chemulpo railway.
The start will be from the station outside the south
gate of the capital; the second stop will be Yong-san, and
the third No-dol. At the next station, Yong-tong-po, the
railway leaves the line of the Seoul-Chemulpo branch to run
due south to Si-heung, where it bears slightly eastward until
reaching An-yang and Syu-won, some twenty-six miles distant
from Seoul. At this point the railway resumes its southerly
direction and passes through Tai-hoang-kyo, O-san-tong, and
Chin-eui, where it crosses the border of the Kyöng-keui Province
into Chyung-chyöng Province, and reaches the town
of Pyöng-tak. The line then runs near the coast, proceeding
due south to Tun-po, where it will touch tide water, and,
bearing due south, reaches On-yang, sixty-nine miles from
Seoul. It then proceeds in a south-easterly direction to
Chyön-eui, and once again turning directly south crosses
the famous Keum River and enters the important town
of Kong-chyu. From Kong-chyu, which is ninety-six miles
from Seoul, and by its fortunate possession of facilities for
water transit, is destined to become an important distributing
centre, the line follows its southward course towards Sin-gyo,
where an important branch line will be constructed towards
the south-west to connect Kang-kyöng, the chief commercial
centre of the province, with the main system. It is also
probable that a further extension of the line from Sin-gyo
towards the south-west will be projected, in order to make
communication with Mokpo, the coast port through which
passes the grain trade of Chyöl-la and Kyöng-syang Provinces.</p>

<p>The town of Sin-gyo marks one hundred and twenty-five
miles from Seoul; beyond Sin-gyo, the south-westerly
direction, which the line is now following, changes by an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
abrupt sweep to the east, where, after passing through Ryön-san,
a western spur of the great mountain chain of the
peninsula is crossed, and the town of Chin-san entered.
Still running east to Keum-san, the valley of the southern
branch of the Yang River is traversed in its upper waters,
until, after following the river in a north-easterly direction
for some little distance, the road takes advantage of a gap
in the mountains, through which the Yang River breaks, to
cross the stream and turn due east to touch Yang-san,
coming to a pause one hundred and forty-one miles from
Seoul in Yöng-dong. From Yöng-dong the railway moves
forward north-east to Whan-gan, one hundred and fifty-three
miles from Seoul, the place lying close within the
mountain range but a few miles distant from the Chyu-pung
Pass—to cross which will call for more than ordinary
engineering skill. Leaving the pass and running slightly
south of east, the railway proceeds towards the Nak-tong
River, through Keum-san, crossing the stream at Wai-koan,
a few miles north-east of Tai-ku, a town of historical
importance some two hundred miles from Seoul. The
railway then follows the valley of the Nak-tong, and passes
to the east of the river, through Hyön-pung, Chyang-pyöng,
Ryöng-san, Syök-kyo-chyön, Ryang-san, Mun-chyön, Tong-lai,
where the Nak-tong River is again met. The direction
from Tai-ku is south-east all the way to Fusan, whence
the line runs beside the river. At Kwi-po it strikes across
to the native town of Old Fusan, thence running round the
Bay to its terminus in the port.</p>

<p>This railway, which provides for extensive reclamation
works in the harbour of Fusan, has become already
an economic factor of very great importance. More
particularly is this manifest when it is remembered that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
country through which the line passes is known as the
granary of Korea. Developments of a substantial character
must follow the completion of this undertaking, the position
of Japan in Korea receiving more emphatic confirmation
from this work than from anything by which her previous
domination of the country has been demonstrated. It will
promote the speedy development of the rich agricultural
and mining resources of Southern Korea, and as these new
areas become accessible by means of the railway, it is
difficult to see how the influx of Japanese immigrants and
settlers to the southern half of the kingdom can be
avoided. Indeed, a very serious situation for the Korean
Government has already arisen, since by far the greatest
number of the men, engaged upon the construction of the
Seoul-Fusan Railway, have signified their intention of becoming
permanent settlers in the country. In the case of
these new settlers, the company has granted from the land,
which it controls on either side of the line, a small plot to
each family for the purposes of settlement. While the man
works upon the line, his family erect a house and open up
the ground. Whether or no the action of the company can
be justified to the extent which has already taken place, the
policy has resulted in the establishment of a continuous
series of Japanese settlements extending through the heart of
Southern Korea from Seoul to Fusan.</p>

<p>From time to time the Japanese Government itself has
attempted to stem the torrent of Japanese migration to
Korea. But the success of the colonies already settled there
has made it a delicate and a difficult task—one which, in the
future, the Japanese Government may be expected to leave
alone. The railway once open, the still greater stimulus
which will be imparted to agriculture in the southern half of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
the kingdom, will appeal to many thousands of other would-be
settlers. Whatever objection the Korean Government may
offer to this invasion, it is quite certain that with the very
heart of the agricultural districts laid bare, Korea must be
prepared to see a rapid increase in her already large
Japanese population. In a great part the increase is
already an accomplished fact. The influence of Japan is
already supreme in Korea. It is paramount in the
Palace; and it is upheld by settlements in every part
of the country. In the capital itself there is a flourishing
colony of four thousand adults. She has established
her own police force; created her own post-office,
telephone, cable and wireless telegraph system. She has
opened mines—her principal mine is at Chik-san—and has
introduced many social and political reforms, besides being
the greatest economic factor in the trade of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Little development has distinguished the concessions
secured by the French in Korea. A railway concession was
abandoned a few years ago; and an existing charter, covering
certain mining rights, has almost expired. M. Colin
de Plancy, the amiable and energetic French Minister in
Korea, has, however, succeeded in re-arranging the terms
of the abandoned concession. In addition to this, in June
1903, he applied for a new gold-mining concession in
Chyung-chyöng Province. The concession, which has been
revived, was granted so far back as 1896; but it was
forfeited long since, and only recently revoked. By
the old agreement a French syndicate, La Compagnie
de Fines-Lille, received a charter to construct a line of
railway between Seoul and Wi-ju, the important frontier
port at the mouth of the Yalu. The construction of this line,
which will form, together with the Seoul-Fusan railway, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
main trunk line of the kingdom, will no longer be the private
speculation of a French syndicate, the Imperial Government
itself having undertaken to make the road. Two
years ago the French Minister succeeded in reviving the
interest of the Korean Government in the scheme, and
secured an undertaking that the services of French engineers
only should be employed, and that the materials for the new
work should be supplied by French houses. In continuation
of this most excellent piece of diplomacy, M. Colin de
Plancy was instrumental, at a little later date, in bringing
about the creation of the North-Western Railway Bureau,
of which the First Secretary of the French Legation, M. G.
Lefevre, was made managing director, with Yi Yong-ik
as its President. M. de Lapeyriere became the chief
consulting engineer to the railway; M. Bourdaret, and a
small army of French engineers, master mechanics, overseers,
and skilled workmen were placed upon the pay-sheets
of the company.</p>

<p>The Korean Government made itself responsible for the
annual disbursement of one hundred thousand yen (£10,000)
on this railway, and construction began in the spring of 1902.
Operations were suspended, however, owing to the prevalence
of the rainy season. Work was resumed again in the
autumn and, again, after a short spell of activity, stopped.
Lack of the necessary funds is doubtless the reason; yet,
nevertheless, the Korean Government refused an offer for
the right to construct the line from a Russian financier.
This preliminary stage of the line traverses districts famous
for their mineral and agricultural resources, and connects
the present capital, Seoul, with two former seats of
Central Government, Song-do and Pyöng-yang, even now
rich and populous towns. It is intended to complete the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
line to Song-do at once, pushing forward towards Wi-ju, in
the hope of connecting with the Trans-Siberian system,
when the Government is able to find the funds. The distance
between Seoul and Song-do by the line of railway
is eighty kilometres. In round figures the cost of construction
is placed at about £260,000; the traffic receipts are
valued at £12,000, £10,000 of which will be contributed by
passenger traffic. The annual working expenses are placed
at £8000; and it is “hoped” that the Seoul-Song-do line
will be opened to general traffic within two years. The
figures are altogether French and airy.</p>

<p>A survey of the line between Seoul and Song-do shows
to some extent the nature of the work which awaits the
French engineers. Gradients will be about 21 feet to
the mile; embankment-building and excavation give 13,000
cubic metres to the kilometre; twenty-six per cent. of
the line will be curved, the radius of the most acute
bend being some 200 metres; twenty-five moderately
large bridges, one hundred and fifty small bridges and
culverts will figure in construction. The Im-chin River
will be crossed, at first, by ferry; in the end, however,
a bridge, five hundred feet in length, will span this
break in the line. The gauge of the road would be
1.43 m.; the ties will be 2.50 m. long, 30 m. in width,
1.25 m. thick. There will be 1.70 kilometres for the purpose
of side-tracking, and an off-line, 1.30 kilometres long, will
branch to Han-chu, on the Han River. Between Seoul and
Song-do there will be six stations and four signal points;
the rolling stock will consist of five locomotives of the
Mallet type, five combined first and second class and eight
third class coaches, five luggage cars, and twenty-five freight
cars. This comprises the general requirements of the proposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
line, evolved out of an abandoned concession by the
astuteness and activity of the French Minister.</p>

<p>The line will proceed from outside the West Gate of
Seoul, where the terminus will be 48.50 m. above the sea
level, towards Yang-wha-chin, crossing the A-o-ya Pass at
59.50 m. Descending to the valley of the Han River, and
17 m. above tide-water, the line traverses the district of
Han-ju, and the western county of Ko-yang, leaving the
Han valley 31 kilometres from Seoul. The line then crosses
the Kyo-wha valley, at an elevation of 15 m., and at 42 kilometres
from Seoul crosses a tributary of the Im-chin River
at Mun-san-po. Fifty-one kilometres from Seoul the
railway will meet the Im-chin River ferry, where passengers
and freight, under the existing provisional arrangements,
will be transferred to a second train upon the remote side
of the river. The line then crosses the Chang-dan district,
and moving up the Valley of Song-do enters the Song-do
terminus at an elevation of 40 m. The distance by rail is
somewhat shorter than by road, and unexpectedly few
obstacles have been met with in the course of construction.
A rough survey has been made north from Song-do, from
which point the railway will run due west to Hai-chu, then
due north to Pyöng-yang through Sin-chyön and An-ak.
Beyond this point to Wi-ju no survey has been attempted.</p>

<p>It is questionable, however, if the French line promises
such satisfactory returns as those which may be expected
from the southern railway. When the two lines have been
completed and Fusan is in direct communication with the
Siberian Railway, some definite expansion in the northern
areas of the kingdom may be anticipated, and the railway
will be in a position to compete with the junks of the Yalu.
But, apart from the border trade, there is little settled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
industry which may be relied on to contribute traffic to the
carrying capacity of this line; nor is it likely that the mines,
whose concessions may be said to border the line of railway,
will accept it as a medium of transportation so long as they
are able to make use of the existing facilities for water
transit, with which the American and English mines are
served. Of course, it cannot be predicted what mining and
agricultural developments may take place in the northern
regions of Korea. Gold and coal, copper and iron are known
to exist. The development of this mineral wealth may open
up the country, and the presence of the mines will create a
demand for the local production of certain varieties of food-stuffs.
These channels of revenue to the railway are highly
problematical. In the absence of any specific value, which
may be attached to the prospects of the French line, a comparison
between the relative importance of the two undertakings
confirms the superiority of the Japanese concession
upon every count. The strategic, as well as the commercial,
significance of the southern trunk line must
impress the Koreans with its very positive qualities.</p>

<p>There are some eighty French subjects in Korea, of
whom forty are French priests and one a bishop. Three
are associated with the North-Western Railway Bureau;
two are in the Korean Customs; two have been given
employment in the Imperial Mines, and one has become
legal adviser to the Imperial Government. One is attached
to the French School; one manages, most admirably and
successfully, the Imperial Korean Post Office. Two are
working in the Korean Arsenal, and three assist in the
management of the Hôtel du Palais. The members of the
French colony have been lately increased by the addition
of a number of French engineers, who have fallen upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
Korean Government in the hope of finding employment
with the Railway Bureau. These transitory visitors are not
included in my figures.</p>

<p>The German colony is small and insignificant. German
interests, however, have been given the concession of a railway
line from Seoul to Won-san. A mine, controlled by
a German syndicate, and located at Tong-ko-kai, has been
abandoned with the loss of the many thousand pounds
which had been laid out upon machinery and mining
material in general. Germans possess no other concessions.
There is an important firm in Chemulpo,
and this house has established a branch in Seoul. A
distinguishing feature of the business is that there are
Germans in both the Seoul and Chemulpo offices who are
thoroughly familiar with the Korean language. This, as the
country develops, will not be without effect; and the fact
seems to illustrate very admirably the methodical system
upon which German commerce in the Far East is built up.
The Court band has been entrusted to the training of a
German professor. The effect is very solemn, and perhaps
discloses the necessity for the introduction of a German
physician to the Imperial Household. This counterblast to
the position, which a singular power of sympathy and great
professional ability has won for Miss Cooke, is of recent
accomplishment. This English lady doctor has been for
many years physician-in-ordinary to the Imperial Household,
and enjoys the complete confidence of the Court.
Miss Cooke is the only foreigner who has succeeded in
overcoming native prejudice and suspicion entirely.</p>

<p>The battle of concessions is as keen in Korea as in China.
The latest Power to interest itself in the exploitation of the
mineral deposits of Korea is Belgium, hitherto without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
special concern in the development of the mining interests
of the kingdom. Now, however, Belgium has come forward,
and it is understood that a concession, nine hundred
square <i>li</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in extent, has been granted to its nationals.
The Belgians have undertaken to lend the Korean Government
4,000,000 yen, receiving in exchange the lease of the
mines for twenty-five years. The concession is situated at
Ta-bäk Mountain, at the point where the Chyung-chyöng,
Kyöng-syang and Kang-won Provinces meet. At this
moment it is impossible to state the value of this new concession;
but the Belgians are shrewd, close-fisted people.
It is doubtful, therefore, if their venture will be as unfortunate
as our own, or the German, has been.</p>

<p>Adverting to the foreign trade of Korea again, foreign merchants
possess a very definite grievance against the Japanese
manufacturing houses who cater for the Korean markets.
After the closest investigation, I venture to assert there are
but few of the so-called foreign-made articles, exposed to
sale in the shops of the Japanese settlements in any of the
open ports in Korea, that are not most shameless imitations.
For the most part they are concocted in Japan, and embellished
with the necessary designs and trade marks, with
some imperceptible modification. The illegality of this
practice is incontrovertible. In the absence of any supervision
upon the part of the Korean Customs, or by representatives
of merchants affected by these tricks, it is difficult
to see how they may be avoided. I add a table, showing
the various articles counterfeited by Japanese manufacturers
with which I am personally familiar, and which are on
sale under false descriptions. In each instance the imitation
comes from Japan.</p>

<p>Some account of the treaty ports; Won-san, Fusan, Mok-po—Character
of export and import trade—Local industries</p>

</div>

<p>The oldest of the settlements in Korea is the port of
Won-san, situated upon the eastern shores of the kingdom,
half-way between Fusan and Vladivostock.</p>

<p>The picturesqueness of its setting makes the spacious
harbour of this bustling treaty port a graceful conclusion to
any tour which has had for its object the inspection of the
scenic loveliness of the Diamond Mountains. There is
little indeed to disturb the placid enjoyment of life amid
the pine-clad bluffs and frowning headlands which surround
the broad waters of the bay. The fact of passing from the
seclusion of wild valleys and rugged heights, sheltering only
the monasteries of Buddha, into the lively atmosphere of a
treaty port does not destroy the illusions which any stay in
the lofty regions of these Twelve Thousand Peaks necessarily
fosters.</p>

<p>Within wooded cliffs, which hang above a fringe of
silver sand, looking out over a harbour forty square miles
in extent, where mountains encompass every quarter of the
horizon, and rocky islets, verdant with vegetation, stud a
sapphire sea, there lies a spot where the fleets of the world
might swing at anchor with perfect safety, in perfect isolation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
It is certainly a wonderful harbour; and worthy of
the commotion caused at intervals by the desire of Russia
to secure possession of the prize. The superb advantages
with which it is endowed make it an object of solicitude to
the Powers. If possession of this harbour were coupled
with the occupation of Vladivostock and Port Arthur, the
control of those northern seas would rest with the Russian
fleet. Otherwise, it is a peaceful place to be the centre
of so much political turmoil.</p>

<p>Won-san, the treaty port, is situated in the south-west
corner of the harbour. The northern arm of the harbour
is known as Port Lazareff; the south-eastern portion is
Broughton Bay, the name which is usually given to the
entire harbour. Captain W. R. Broughton, the English
navigator, first entered it on October 4, 1797, in his
sloop-of-war of 16 guns, <i>Providence</i>. Port Lazareff is
about sixteen miles from Won-san, in a westerly direction
across the bay, at the mouth of the Dun river. It is
the point which Russia was credited with the intention of
securing for the terminus of her Trans-Siberian Railway.
There are two entrances into Broughton Bay, one giving
direct admission into Port Lazareff. Russian men-of-war
make the most of this advantage in visiting the harbour, for
it enables them to enter without revealing their presence to
the authorities upon shore. Upon one occasion, when I was
visiting the neighbourhood, I surprised parties from two
Russian men-of-war engaged in surveying the hills and
taking soundings of the anchorages; their presence was
quite unsuspected by the Japanese Consul or by the Commissioner
of Customs.</p>

<p>The bay is well protected by chains of mountains, its
physical perfections in this respect rendering it of peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
value as a naval base. The channel into the harbour is
broad, deep, and free from all encumbrances. Numerous
islands are so situated about the mouth that every approach
could be strongly protected. Besides being easy of access,
there is an average depth of about nine fathoms upon a
firm bottom. The water is free from ice in winter, notwithstanding
the severity of the cold in this region. Inexhaustible
supplies of spring water can be obtained; and, in
the proper season, the shooting and fishing afford very
varied sport. These are, however, but the accessories to a
harbour, which, if it were fortified and converted into a
first-class naval station, would be the equal of Vladivostock
and superior to every other station in the Far East. It is
far in advance of anything which the Powers have seized in
China.</p>

<p>Between Hong Kong and Dalny, the commercial harbour
of Port Arthur, which Russia has endeavoured to improve
since it belonged to China, there is no anchorage which
could be so readily and inexpensively adapted to the requirements
of a first-class naval station of a first-class naval
Power. At present, Won-san harbour is visited only by the
squadrons which Russia and Japan maintain in this water.
Although there is a flourishing Japanese settlement upon
shore, no Japanese gun-boat is detached as yet for guardship
duties. At Fusan and Chemulpo, however, the practice of
detailing ships for port duties is carefully observed, Japan
losing few opportunities to impress upon her neighbour in
particular, and the world in general, the significance of her
interests in Korea.</p>

<p>Won-san was opened to Japanese trade in 1880, becoming
a general foreign settlement on November 3rd, three years
later. Although its subsequent development is due entirely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
to the industry of the Japanese, and their undoubted commercial
sagacity, its imports of foreign trade in recent years
have contributed to the position which it now takes in the
commercial progress of the country. The economic expansion
of the port, however, has been promoted by the business
resulting from the immigration of Japanese settlers and the
doubling of the native population. Materials for clothing,
cotton goods, grass-cloth, and silk are pre-eminent in the
local requirements. A comparison of the annual returns
discloses a steady advance in its prosperity, the paramount
influence, which the Japanese exercise over its welfare,
restricting foreign trade to those articles which cannot be
imported from Japan. Business has just doubled in six
years; but the increase in the import trade is not in favour
of British goods. The imposition of the tariff, which prevails
in European Russia, at Vladivostock, accounted
for the general advance in foreign imports at Won-san
during 1901. In the following year, 1902, the imports
were again heavier than the exports, the figures being:
Imports, £191,535, and exports, £102,205. The local
government of the port is conducted upon Japanese lines.
The streets are broad, well gravelled, and fringed with an
irregular border of trees. After the foul and narrow lanes of
the Korean town, through which it is necessary to pick one’s
way before entering the settlement, their appearance is
cheerful and attractive.</p>

<p>Won-san, the native town which has given its name to
the port, is two miles from the heart of the settlement, and
comprises a quaint medley of thatched and tiled houses,
crowded together in narrow and noisome alleys. The main
road from Seoul to the frontier, one of the six great roads
of the country, lies through the centre of the town. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
clusters of hovels, upon both sides of this excellent highway,
suggest that the eligible sites are only those which
abut upon this spacious thoroughfare. Glimpses of the bay
are visible through gaps in the houses. The smell of the
sea is lost in the fumes of drying fish and decaying garbage,
which hang heavily in the atmosphere, impregnating everything
and penetrating everywhere, save to the wind-swept
heights which encircle the bay. A population of 15,000
huddles in these groups of thatched shops and tumble-down
houses.</p>

<p>The native town ceases abruptly about a mile from the
settlement. Fields of vegetables border the road. The strip
of beach upon which the town is placed, is black with patches
of fish spread to the sun, littered with fishing nets, and encumbered
with crazy fishing-boats and junks. After a little
it disappears around cliffs, whose crests are fragrant with pine
and fir trees. Tortuous valleys, giving glimpses of prosperous
villages set in their midst against a background of
majestic peaks and ridges of hills, well-timbered headlands
and promontories upon which are set the houses of the
missionaries, combine, with the broad waters of the bay
and the vista of the open sea beyond, to form a series of
picturesque and supremely attractive views. There are nearly
three thousand Japanese in residence at Won-san, a few
Chinese merchants, and a small foreign community, including
the Commissioner of Customs and Mrs. Wakefield,
and the Customs staff. The rest are evangelists of no
great importance.</p>

<p>The climate of Won-san is dry and healthy. The heat
is tempered by sea breezes and the nights are cool. The
mean temperature for the summer is seventy-three degrees,
and for the winter twenty-nine degrees; the rainfall is forty-four<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
inches, a little greater than that upon the west coast.
Snow falls to a depth of four feet, covering the mountains
from October until May. The port is, however, rather
cooler than Chemulpo in summer and a little warmer in
winter, the dryness of the atmosphere considerably modifying
the cold. The splendour of an autumn sky continues
throughout the winter, when the principal shooting is to be
obtained.</p>

<p>Much historical interest attaches to many of the more
beautiful spots in the vicinity. From this neighbourhood
sprang the kings of Ancient Ko-ryö; and again, it gave birth
to the reigning house of Cho-syön, for, in the monastery of
Sok-wan, twenty-two miles distant, A Tai-cho, the first king
of the present dynasty, was educated and lived. The
monastery itself, with its temples, was erected by the
King to mark the spot where, 509 years ago, he received
that supernatural summons to rule, in virtue of which his
descendants now occupy the throne. In the seclusion of
this beautiful spot, the early years of A Tai-cho were passed in
meditation, study, and preparation for his future kingship.
Many of the magnificent trees, which embower the temples
and rise in stately dignity from the grand mountain clefts,
in which the monastery is situated, are reputed to have been
planted by his hands. In a building apart, into which no
one is allowed to enter, save the monk in whose keeping the
relics are placed, his regalia and robes of State are preserved
to this day.</p>

<p>Won-san is situated in the southern corner of the province
of Ham-kyöng. A considerable portion of its trade is
carried on with the closely adjoining divisions of Pyöng-an
and Kang-won, the three provinces forming the northern
half of the kingdom; their population is variously estimated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
at between three and five millions. Mountains predominate
in these districts. A bewildering tangle of wooded hills
and bleak peaks meets the eye, jumbling and jostling one
another in every direction until nothing is seen but broken
mountains and ridges cleft into a thousand little valleys.
More especially is this the case in Ham-kyöng and Kang-won;
in Pyöng-an the valleys broaden out and the hills become
lower and less frequent, giving place to the Ta-dong River,
and many wide spaces for agricultural purposes. Among
these broken ranges in the neighbourhood of Won-san, and
towards the interior, there is much sport. Sable, ermine,
and otter are trapped in Northern Ham-kyöng; tigers,
leopards, bears, wolves and foxes are rare in fact, plentiful
in fiction. Wild boar, deer and hares are not uncommon;
pheasants are less numerous than formerly. Snipe appear
in August, duck in September, geese and wild fowl in the
winter on the marshes and lagoons. There is much game
upon the land, and there is much sport in the sea. Whales,
shark, seal, salmon, and innumerable small species wait to
be caught, the products of sea and land combining to make
the place a sportsman’s paradise.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>IN NEW FUSAN</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The approach to the treaty port of Fusan is through a
bay strewn with green islands and encompassed by high
cliffs. A narrow path, skirting the shore and running over
the cliffs, leads presently to Old Fusan, a walled city of great
antiquity, situated at the end of a stretch of ten miles of sea,
which forms one of the arms of the bay. New Fusan is like
every other Korean treaty port. The smells of the Japanese
settlement were worse, however, very much worse, as I well
remember, than any which rose from the sewers and slimy
alleys of the old town. Old Fusan stands alone, at the head
of the bay, looking down from its ruined and crumbling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
walls across the waste of water, musing in decrepit isolation
upon departed glories. New Fusan, the foreign quarter, is
very noisy, very dirty, and uncomfortable. The Japanese
shopkeepers make little attempt to provide for other aliens;
the wretched hotel demurs at receiving them. The place is
thoroughly Japanese, prosperous, active, and enduring. It is
the focus of the tumble-down steamers which run between the
ports of Korea and Japan, venturing even to Taku, Port
Arthur and Vladivostock. Upon all sides there is the appearance
of industry and trade, inseparable from any Japanese
community. In conjunction with the Seoul-Fusan Railway
a vast scheme of harbour reclamation is in progress. This
will provide suitable sites for godowns, in which the port is
sadly deficient. The making of roads, the installation of
electric light, and the construction of large waterworks are
the objects which have already received the attention of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
Japanese authorities. There is a Japanese Consul-General
in Fusan, who administers Japanese law to some fourteen
thousand of his fellow countrymen. Half of this number is
comprised in the floating population, whose sole business is
fishing. The valuable fisheries lying off the coast and in the
adjacent archipelago return an annual yield of ten million
herring and half a million cod. Altogether, the bustle and
confusion of the place supports its claim to be the most important
of the treaty ports of Korea, in spite of the neglect
with which British merchants treat it. The actual Japanese
population of the Fusan settlement in 1901 was seven
thousand and fourteen, an increase of more than one
thousand upon the returns of the previous year—six
thousand and four. Since then there has been a further
increase, and the population at the present time falls little
short of nine thousand.</p>

<p>The activity of the Japanese in the open ports of Korea
does not correspond in any way to the size of the port.
Whatever may be the local conditions, there is no falling-off
in their untiring enterprise. If the port has been established
ten or twenty years, or only one, their commercial vigour is
the same. After the settlements of Won-san, Fusan, and
Chemulpo, a visit to the port of Mok-po, declared open in
the autumn of 1897, fails to elicit much which is new or
important. Mok-po is very small. To those who are interested
in the subject, it gives an excellent example of the
cool, resolute manner in which the Japanese build up a very
flourishing settlement upon the foundations of an unprepossessing
native village. The pioneers of the ports in
Korea, it is natural that they should select the best available
sites for their own quarter. At Mok-po, repeating a system
which was adopted in the case of Fusan, Won-san, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
Chemulpo, the Japanese settlement commands the one
situation which is adaptable for commercial purposes. The
approaches to Mok-po lie through a network of island and
rock-strewn channels, the largest of which is some six
hundred yards wide. The harbour is the embouchure of the
River Ru-yong-san, the main water-way of the province,
some ninety miles long. It can accommodate forty vessels
of large tonnage. The best passage is through Lyne Sound,
but easy access is given, from the south, by Washington
Gulf. The width of the harbour is a little less than two
miles, with a depth at low water of eleven fathoms, rising to
nineteen on a full tide. At ebb tide the current averages
five knots an hour; during the spring tides this velocity
increases, adding to the disadvantages offered by an
indifferent holding-ground.</p>

<p>Mok-po is situated in the south-western corner of the
Province of Chyöl-la, sometimes called the granary of
Korea. The port takes its name from a large island, which
faces it on the north, and forms the entrance to the river.
It is picturesque and stands sufficiently high to break the
monotony of the surrounding country. Rough and barren
to look upon, it possesses the nucleus of what will become
an important settlement as trade increases. The buildings
of the Japanese Consulate and the Customs House are the
most imposing structures at present in the place. The
British Consulate, a mass of rock, unadorned, bluff, bare
and bleak, is the most desolate and depressing. A vista
of mud flats does not add to the beauty of this spot. A
well-built sea-wall, behind which some acres of marshy
shore have been reclaimed, indicates the spirit in which the
Japanese set to work to improve their concessions.</p>

<p>A composite trade centres at Mok-po, exceeding one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
hundred thousand pounds in value. Foreign imports stand for
quite eighty thousand of this total. It is, perhaps, needless to
add that no British shipping has entered the harbour within
the six years of its existence. German and American
steamers have nevertheless brought cargoes to Mok-po;
Japanese steamers touch regularly. The trade is that of
a native market,
whose demands
can be furnished
from Japan; it is,
of course, beneath
the notice of the
British exporter.
Piece goods, Japanese
and American
cigarettes,
matches, yarn, articles
which the
humbler classes now use and for which, owing to the
rapidly increasing native population of this south-western
Province, there will be greater demand in the future, make
up the trade.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>PALACE GATEWAY</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It may be that this port, despised by the British
merchant, as are all the ports of Korea, will some day head
the centres of commerce of the kingdom. Even now it
attracts foreign goods from Japan, America, and Germany.
There are many channels through which British wares,
cheap, enduring, practical and suitable to prevailing conditions
could filter to the advantage of the British merchant.
Cereals are raised in large quantities, straw-matting, grass-cloth,
paper and fans are the other native manufactures. A
vein of bituminous coal has been struck within a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
of the port. In two industries—the making of paper
and the weaving of grass-cloth—there are opportunities for
expansion, which any enterprising and intelligent agent
could promote by introducing cheap chemicals and inexpensive
mechanical appliances. In the paper-making trade
alone there is a rich harvest to be garnered by the firm who
will choose to devote time, energy and patience to the
creation of a business in alkalies. Already the basis of a
remunerative connection exists among the villages devoted
to this labour.</p>

<p>Treaty Ports (<i>continued</i>)—Wi-ju—Syön-chyön-po—Chin-am-po—Pyöng-yang—Kun-san—Syöng-chin</p>

</div>

<p>The ports which remain to be mentioned, have not yet
attained a commercial importance entitling them to any
great consideration. They afford, however, a signal illustration
of the enterprising spirit in which the Koreans have
met the demands made upon them, and, as the interests
of the country increase, the natural expansion of the inland
trade will enhance their value.</p>

<p>Hitherto, Southern Korea has been better served in the
matter of open ports than the northern half of the kingdom.
With the addition to the list of treaty ports of Syöng-chin,
upon the north-eastern coast, and Chin-am-po (with
Pyöng-yang, an old-time capital of Korea, and ranking
to-day as the third city of the Empire, in close proximity),
upon the western coast, greater facilities have been accorded
to the commercial development of the almost unknown
markets of Northern Korea. In view, however, of the trade
in the southern provinces of the kingdom, the port of Kun-san
was created on the west coast simultaneously with the
opening of Syöng-chin in 1899 upon the north-east shore.
This port lies between Chemulpo and Mok-po, at the mouth
of the Keum River, the natural boundary between the
two provinces, Chyöl-la and Chyung-chyöng.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, to the north and north-east regions
that foreign commerce must look for that impetus to
industrial activity, which comes from the opening of
new markets. A most important trade-centre already
exists in Wi-ju, at the mouth of the Yalu river. This
town requires to be opened; in the meantime, its position
upon the border of Manchuria attracts a varied and valuable
direct trade. Moreover, if Wi-ju were brought under the
administration and control of the Maritime Customs of
Korea, and included among those ports which have already
been declared, a greater restraint could be put upon the
smugglers, who have made it a centre of communication
in their illicit trade. At this moment it is difficult to say
whether Wi-ju may be quite properly included among the
treaty ports. If official assurances can be safely accepted,
the Government of Korea decided on August 22nd, 1903, to
declare Wi-ju an open port, at the same time placing a
Customs house at Yong-an-po. The difference between
the two is hardly greater than that separating Pyöng-yang
from Chin-am-po. Unfortunately, this decision is by no
means definite, although a few days later, on September 4th,
an announcement to the same effect was made by the
Foreign Office at Seoul to the foreign representatives. This
official ratification of its previous decision would carry
conviction if the policy of the Korean Cabinet were less
vacillating, and the opposition of the Russian Minister less
strenuous. The Russian Minister objects in an equal
degree to the opening of Yong-an-po, and, since M. Colin
de Plancy, the French Minister, is supporting his Russian
colleague, M. Pavloff, in opposition to the opening of Wi-ju,
future developments may prove M. Pavloff to have withdrawn
his objections against Wi-ju in order that he can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
concentrate them upon Yong-an-po. Unfortunately for
Russian interests, British policy in Korea favours the
opening of both ports, an action in which Mr. Jordan, the
British Minister in Seoul, is cordially supported by many
of his colleagues.</p>

<p>The action of the British Government in respect of
these ports on the Yalu is quite encouraging, and it is
equally satisfactory to see that Mr. Jordan has maintained
his attitude with admirable consistency. The demand of
the British Government was presented to his Majesty at a
special audience on July 14th, 1903. It evoked at once the
opposition of the Russians, whose objections were communicated
officially to the Korean Government when, a
few days later, the British Minister sent a despatch to the
Foreign Office to inquire upon what date Wi-ju would
become an open port. Meanwhile, the Japanese Minister
reiterated the request of the British Government, which, at
the same time, was supported by an identical demand from
the Chinese Foreign Office, through the Korean Minister in
Pekin. For a few days matters remained stationary, the
situation becoming a little involved by the resignation of
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yi To-chai, upon the plea
of ill-health. The Emperor refused the resignation, and
on August 9th the British Minister sent an urgent despatch,
which demanded the opening of Wi-ju within seven days.
A few days later a decision, favourable to the request of the
British Minister, was delivered, and it remains to be seen
whether permanent effect will be given to it. Meanwhile,
as the readiest means of giving effect to the new dignity of
the port, a small <i>posse</i> of Japanese police has been sent to
Wi-ju to protect the settlement.</p>

<p>Syön-chyön-po, the youngest of the open ports, is in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
very early days. It is situated about forty miles to the
south of Wi-ju. Its future prosperity is uncertain, but
from its position, midway between Chin-am-po and Wi-ju,
it should become an important port of call for native
shipping. At present Syön-chyön-po is administered from
Chin-am-po, but the lines of its future settlement have
been planned, and it will doubtless develop into a thriving
Japanese colony. For the moment there is little trade.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus52" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus52.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>CHEMULPO</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Ta-dong River, at the estuary of which Chin-am-po
lies, is one of the most important and picturesque streams
in the country. It drains the southern and south-eastern
divisions of Pyöng-an Province; upon its banks, sixty-seven
miles from the sea, is Pyöng-yang, the early capital
and oldest city of the Empire. Around Pyöng-yang still
lingers a host of romantic associations, historical and
legendary. Towns and villages are found upon the banks
of the Ta-dong; there is much rugged beauty in the
scenery, and the water-shed has landmarks of great
physical and historical importance. The velocity of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
river current during the spring tides averages three and
a quarter knots. During the ebb, over against the Chin-am-po
bank, there is an increase of two knots caused by a
projecting point upon the opposite shore of the river. The
formation of the Ta-dong inlet is irregular; many indentations,
which mark the outline of the anchorage, become mud
flats at low water. Prior to the selection of Chin-am-po as a
treaty port, the native village consisted of a few straggling
huts and a population of less than one thousand. Now,
however, the old order has given way to the new. The
mud flats have been reclaimed and so many improvements
have taken place in the general conditions of the
port that a bright future may be confidently predicted
for it.</p>

<p>Chin-am-po, the settlement, is situated upon the
northern shore of the Ta-dong inlet, about fifteen miles
from its entrance in the extreme south-west of Pyöng-an
Province. The port was opened to foreign trade in October
1897. During the few years of its existence as an open port,
Chin-am-po has made no little progress. At the present
time it gives promise of becoming an exceedingly important
commercial centre. The increase of the foreign trade and
the flourishing condition of the native market have attracted
the attention of the Japanese, who have already made a considerable
settlement in the port. Estimates of the native
population vary from fifteen to forty thousand, the smaller
figure being nearer the mark. The trade compares favourably,
in point of value and bulk, with that of ports of equal
capacity, similarly situated. Its development is somewhat
restricted, the two great forces contributing to its material
economy being the impetus which has been given to local
agricultural resources, and the mining industry. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
concessions of the American and British Mining Companies
at Un-san and Eun-san were granted, Chin-am-po became
the port of shipment for much of their traffic.</p>

<p>The commercial possibilities of the region, which lies
between the Ta-dong River and the water-shed of the Yalu,
are in the earliest stages of development. Much might be
predicted of the returns which these new fields would yield
to intelligent exploitation. Cut off from the eastern division
of the kingdom by ranges of mountains, and extending from
Po-reup-san, near Chin-am-po, in the south, to the mountain
fastnesses of the northern frontiers of the Empire, is a
stretch of country in part uninhabited. It is frequented by
bands of Korean robbers and Chinese bandits; the centre
of much native mining and the scene of perpetual border
warfare. The haunt of the wild beast, barren and almost impenetrable,
it is practically untouched by Western civilisation.
Its groves of pines and firs, and acres of woods, recall the
time when Northern Korea was one vast forest. Until quite
lately there were but two open ports for the service of this
region, Chin-am-po and Pyöng-yang. The third, Syön-chyön-po,
in its northern extremity, is still closed to Europeans.
Gold and coal, iron and copper, are among its natural
resources. The soil is productive; and the moment is
ripe for the initiation of industrial enterprises. Moreover,
commercial prosperity would introduce a more pacific note
into the condition of these lone lands.</p>

<p>Pyöng-yang lies upon the borders of an extensive anthracite
and bituminous coal district. The outcroppings are
plainly traceable, although at present not indicative of any
very serviceable quality of fuel. Coal, however, is not the
least of the minerals, nor are the resources of the soil confined
to the production of beans. Stone quarrying and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
timber industry flourish in the province. The authentic
records of Pyöng-yang go back some three thousand years,
the creation of the city coinciding with that of the Kingdom
of Israel. Saul, David, and Solomon were the contemporaries
of Ki-ja and his successors. In more modern times
the most stirring events recorded are the massacre of the crew
of the “General Sherman,” in 1866, and the long chapter of
vicissitudes which befell the city during the Chino-Japanese
campaign. The ravages of war and the devastation of pestilence
in 1895 left a deserted and ruined city. Nevertheless,
as if to remind the inhabitants of the former dignity of their
town, the tide of its fortunes turned, and some measure of
prosperity returned. In the interval, trade revived; a small
foreign community now lives within the walls, and it is
hoped that the days of evil omen are as distant as are the
times when this old-world capital first enclosed herself
within protecting walls. Commercially and industrially it
has advanced enormously; and, as a sign of the times,
may be mentioned the fact that the native community has
founded a private English Language school. Pyöng-yang
is associated so intimately with Chin-am-po that the two
are inseparably united in any survey of the fortunes of
either. Nevertheless, the continuation of Pyöng-yang as
an open port is uncertain, the Korean Government
having expressed the intention of closing the port if they
are compelled to throw open Wi-ju. The British, American
and Japanese representatives have resolutely opposed this
suggestion.</p>

<p>The port of Kun-san, which was thrown open in May
1899, to foreign settlement and general trade, taps channels
in the main identical with those which supply Mok-po.
Depending to a great extent upon the agricultural resources<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
of the provinces of Chyöl-la and Chyung-chyöng, its trade is
confined to the exportation of cereals, such as rice, wheat,
and beans; of grass-cloth, paper, and bamboo articles; and
of varieties of fish and seaweed. When the railway between
Seoul and Fusan is completed, the development of the agricultural
resources of these areas will re-act upon the
fortunes of this port. It is, however, quietly thriving in the
interval, content to play a prominent <i>rôle</i> in the coast trade
rather than to figure as a port of call, in any exchange of commodities
with China and Japan. In early days, the port itself
was well known as the export station for revenue rice, when
the Government revenues were paid in grain. The practice
has not been maintained in more recent years. In Kun-san
there is an increasing colony of Japanese, a large native
population, and a small Chinese community. The import
trade, however, is confined to Japanese manufactures, including,
broadly, those counterfeits of foreign goods—Manchester
shirtings, Chinese lawns, Indian yarns, American
kerosene and English and Swedish matches—in the production
of which our lively imitators have attained an unusual
standard of perfection.</p>

<p>The most isolated of all the open ports is Syöng-chin, upon
the north-eastern coast, in the province of Ham-kyöng,
about one hundred and twenty miles from Won-san. It
was opened in May 1899; the trade, principally with
Won-san, and carried on by Japanese, is unimportant.
There is a field for expansion, as gold, copper, and coal
exist within a short distance of the town. There are also
white granite quarries in the neighbourhood. The off-shore
sea-fishing supports a colony of Japanese; large
numbers of cattle are raised for the market in the province,
and the country around is under cultivation for beans. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
export trade is in beans, hides, and fish; the imports include
kerosene, matches, and cotton goods. There is no direct
native trade with Japan. The present condition of Syöng-chin
suggests that it was once a fortified town of importance.
There are the ruins of a high protecting wall,
surmounted with watch-towers and battlements. Time,
poverty and neglect are responsible for its present impoverished
condition. There is a small native population.
The anchorage is little more than an open roadstead. It is
easy of access, deep, and has an excellent holding. Vessels
drawing ten feet can lie within a short distance of the shore.
Fogs and high winds prevail in spring, but, upon the
whole, the climate is more temperate at all seasons than
Won-san.</p>

<p>The port lies near the 41st parallel, facing nearly north-east,
midway between Won-san and Vladivostock. The prevailing
wind, winter and summer, blows from the south-west.
It is only in times of atmospheric disturbance, an infrequent
condition in these latitudes, that a north-east blow renders
the anchorage unsafe, and compels vessels to shift their
moorings to the north-east end of the bay, where the
Sarako headland gives them shelter. Water to the depth
of five fathoms obtains within 200 yards of the shore. The
rise and fall of spring tides is about two feet. No
obstacles present themselves to the building of a landing-stage
and boat harbour. When the port was opened, a few
huts represented the native town. Since then about
250 houses have been erected, and more are being
built. At no distant date it is probable that Syöng-chin
will displace the neighbouring Im-myöng as the market
place. The foreign community is represented by a Japanese
Consul and staff, Japanese police force and postal staff,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
schoolmaster, shipping agent and workmen. A British
doctor and his family, belonging to the Canadian Mission,
reside there. The only foreign house erected within
the settlement limits is that occupied by the Japanese
Consul.</p>

<p>Russian interests—Russia and Japan—Ma-san-po—Ching-kai-wan—Yong-an-po</p>

</div>

<p>Russian industrial activity in Korea may be regarded as
a cloak for political schemes. Since the time that the
Emperor became the protected guest of the Russian Legation,
the influence of Russia in Korea has been more definite
in quality. Assisted by French capital, a Russian company
has started recently a cattle ranch and sheep-run at A-ya-chin,
on the coast of Kang-won Province, with a view to the
establishment of a canning factory, which is now in process
of construction. In addition to this, she has set up a glass
factory at Seoul, a proceeding which throws no light upon
her motives. She has promoted the Pacific Whale Fishing
Company, which, plying its trade off the coast of Korea,
collects very valuable information of unsurveyed bays
and unsounded anchorages, water-holes, coal-deposits, and
currents—and occasionally catches a whale. It possesses
twelve vessels. Russia controls no railway line in Korea,
although she is interested in the line which the French are
building; no gold mine, but a geographical exploration
party of naval officers has been topographically examining
the region of the Yalu River for some years. She has been
accorded certain rights in Ma-san-po; she is endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
to secure the concession of a site suitable for a naval
station, and through virtue of a lumber felling concession
on the Yalu, she has located herself at Yong-an-po. In
May 1903, too, a commercial commission travelled from
Seoul to Wi-ju, overland.</p>

<p>As rapidly as circumstances permit, Russia is connecting
her Manchurian telegraphic system with the trunk lines of
Korea, and telegraphic communication is in course of construction
between Mukden and Wi-ju, Vladivostock and
Won-san. The action of Russia in this respect has encountered
very great opposition from Korea. When the
Korean Cabinet declined to grant permission for the
erection of the poles, for which the Russian engineers had
not waited, M. Pavloff, the Russian Minister, delicately
hinted that the removal of the poles would be regarded
as an unfriendly act, and one liable to create unpleasantness
between the two Governments. The Korean Government,
however, were not frightened into drawing back, and for
some months past the local officials have been occupied in
cutting down whatever poles the Russians might erect.
Russia, also, proposes to rebuild the telegraph line from
Pekin to Seoul <i>viâ</i> Wi-ju, while further, it is her avowed
intention to construct from Mukden a branch of her
railway to An-tung on the Yalu River.</p>

<p>Russia has been associated, also, with the Korean army,
the Russian military authorities having lent a number of
drill-instructors to the Korean service. They have now
been withdrawn. The management of the residence, in
which apartments are found for the guests of the Imperial
Court, has been entrusted to a Russian lady. There are
very few Russian residents in Seoul. Those who live there
comprise the immediate <i>personnel</i> of the Legation, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Legation guards, priests of the Greek Church, and some
sprinkling of the shop-keeping element. The colony is small,
but contrives, with the aid of a port guardship at Chemulpo
and constant visits from the Pacific Squadron, when performances
are given by the band from the guard-ship for
the delectation of the Imperial Court, to support the majesty
and dignity of the Russian Government with much impressive
display. Proposals have been recently made to establish
consulates in the open ports of the Empire—the Consulate
from the capital is now established at Chemulpo; to increase
the services of the steamers of the Manchurian Railway
between the open ports of Korea and Manchuria, and to
found a branch of the Russo-Chinese Bank at Chemulpo.
It is intended, too, that the Russian Pacific Squadron shall
use the Korean harbours more frequently as ports of call.</p>

<p>For some years Russia has been gradually feeling her
way in Korea. Prior to 1885 there were over twenty
thousand Koreans settled in her Far Eastern possessions,
while in 1888 Russia concluded a Commercial Convention
with Korea, which opened the Korean land frontier to
Russian traders. In 1893 telegraphic communication
between Russia and Korea was arranged, when, just as
the Russian policy towards Korea perhaps was beginning
to shape itself, war between China and Japan was declared.
Whatever conclusions may have been anticipated as the
results of such a war, there can be no doubt that its effect
upon the actual destinies of Russia and Japan in the Far
East was far-reaching. The policy of Russia towards
China underwent a change, while the ultimate possession
of Korea became equally the objective of Japan as of
the greater Power. Russia, however, could not afford
to profit at the moment by the downfall of China, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
Japan was not strong enough to hold the Liao-tung
Peninsula nor bold enough to seize Korea. Nevertheless,
driven out of the Liao-tung by the action of Russia, France
and Germany, Japan might still have secured for herself
complete material and political ascendency over Korea. In
time, if such had been her policy, she could have made
manifest, too, her occupation of the kingdom and equipped
herself with an argument, the parallel of that possessed by
Great Britain in Egypt, and by Russia in Manchuria. Unhappily,
while Russia with masterly deliberation was moving
steadily forward in her subjugation of Manchuria, Japan,
whole-hearted but ignorant of the pitfalls of colonial expansion,
was creating endless difficulties for herself in Korea,
besides serious complications with the Powers outside the
scenes of her activities. Before she had realised the potentialities
of her position, she had committed herself to a
design by which she hoped to secure the King and Queen
and to direct herself the reins of government. But her
<i>coup d’état</i> was to recoil disastrously, and at once, upon her
own head. The Queen fell a victim to the plot, and
although the King was imprisoned, he, together with the
Crown Prince, contrived in a little time to find refuge
in the Russian Legation. The escape of the King only
emphasised the failure of Japan, and despite her subsequent
treaties with Russia, in respect of Korea, the balance of
power in the Far East as between Russia and Japan has
never quite recovered from the blow which Japan administered
herself to her own prestige upon this occasion.</p>

<p>Japan still wields material influence of a high order in
Korea. But, within the paramount position which she
fills, there is the rift caused by the spread of the antagonistic
and insidious influence of her great opponent. Curiously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
enough, the position which Russia holds to-day is not
nearly as assertive as that which she occupied in 1896, yet
there is little doubt that her influence is more commanding,
if less conspicuously aggressive. Japan has turned aside
upon occasion from the political issues to develop her commercial
interests. Russia, again, has pursued unswerving
the policy which revealed with the fall of China the fact
that Manchuria was within her grasp and that Korea was
its entail.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>ON THE YALU RIVER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The action of Russia upon the Yalu River at the present
time, her action in respect of Won-san in the past, are each
animated by this <i>motiv</i>. Russia regards Korea as the completion
of her dominions in the Far East, while Japan looks
upon the little kingdom as the corollary to that expansion
which is essential to the existence of the Island Empire.
Russia in Manchuria and Korea, with her shadow projected
over China, would mean a sentence of perpetual restriction
and shrinkage for Japan. But, similarly, Russia from her
position at Vladivostock and Port Arthur must regard the
occupation of Korea by Japan as a wedge with its point
projected towards the centre of her Manchurian communications.
Just as, therefore, the fear of a Russian descent
upon Korea has excited Japan, the necessity for such action
has brought the crisis in the relations between Japan and
Russia so perceptibly nearer. Private agreements and
secret overtures have paved the way for the <i>denouement</i>
which long since was disclosed. When Russia endeavoured
to requisition the harbour of Ma-san-po for the requirements
of her Pacific Squadron, an indication was afforded that
Russian activity in Korea would be concealed no longer.
Ma-san-po has since become an open port, the Government
of Japan at once formulating ingenious objections to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Russian scheme at the same time that they threatened the
Government of Korea with threats of immediate reprisals. But
prior to the conditions laid down by Russia in the Ma-san-po
Convention of 1900 with the Korean Government, this
magnificent harbour had already attracted the attention of
the Japanese and Chinese settlers. By force of circumstances,
therefore, the place became an open port, the local
authorities being powerless to check the influx of foreigners
and the creation of a foreign zone around the harbour.
That M. Pavloff, the clever Russian diplomatic representative
in Seoul, succeeded in bringing about any agreement at all is
remarkable, taking into account the panic-stricken state to
which the Imperial Government was reduced by Japanese
intimidation. The secret convention between the Russian
and Korean Governments, entered into during 1900, preserved
the independence of the harbour, and, failing to confirm
Russia in the definite occupation of Ma-san-po, provided
that none of the land about Ma-san-po harbour or its
approaches should be permanently ceded or sold to any
foreign Power. The same conditions applied to the island
of Keu-chai, situated in the mouth of the harbour. This curtailment
of the ambitions of Russian policy, in this particular
direction, due, of course, to the energetic action of Japan,
did not make the position of Russia in Ma-san-po in any
sense secure. Japan, even then upon the eve of her declaration,
would have gone to war with Russia, if that Power had
attempted to maintain an isolated and complete domination
of this harbour and its approaches against her wishes.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the present condition of Ma-san-po
which suggests that it may become a centre of Russian
influence in Southern Korea. The Japanese demanded,
even before the incident had quite blown over, a large tract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
of land at Ma-san-po for the purposes of making a settlement
there. In addition to this, the quarter, marked off for
foreign settlements, has been almost wholly appropriated by
the Japanese, who have erected shops and houses of some
importance to the extent of several hundred, upon the more
suitable sites. Japanese postal and telegraphic offices have
been opened in Ma-san-po, and an uncomfortable hostelry
disturbs the rest of the weary. A large permanent staff
of Japanese police has been detached for duty in Ma-san-po,
and the next feature in the development of affairs will be
the detailing of a port guardship and the usual infantry
garrison to protect the Japanese settlement. These acts
imply a permanent lease and constitute the methods
by which the Japanese propose to invalidate the Russo-Korean
Convention. The aim of Japanese policy in Ma-san-po
is to discount as far as possible the rights of the Russians,
and to deprive their existence in the harbour of any special
significance. The Russians accept the position with extreme
philosophy and indifference. If they wished to do so, they
might raise protest after protest against the intrusive
character of Japanese action in the areas affected by the
clauses of the Agreement of 1900.</p>

<p>Twelve months ago the foreign population of Ma-san-po
consisted of two hundred and thirty Japanese, forty-one
Chinese, eighteen Russians, and two Germans. These
figures include male and female heads of population, but
no children. The actual strength of the Russian colony in
this harbour was eight men, ten women, three children; of
the Japanese only seventy-eight were females. There is
little import and export traffic. The nearness of Fusan,
which is only six hours distant, makes it unnecessary to
trade direct with the settlement. Japanese steamers from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
Fusan call daily, local produce being brought round by
native junks. There is a large fishing industry off the
harbour; it is, however, quite controlled by Japanese fishermen
from Fusan. The principal industry on shore is the
construction of the settlement, some little agriculture, and
no little gossip.</p>

<p>Since the failure of her efforts to secure Ma-san-po,
Russia has endeavoured to obtain the lease of Ching-kai-wan,
sometimes called Chin-hai or Shin-hai, a bay situated
in the extreme south of the Korean peninsula, as a naval
station. The position of this harbour is exactly midway
between Vladivostock and Port Arthur. Owing to its
geographical situation, the presence of Russia in sole
possession of Ching-kai-wan would be certain to give rise
to even greater demonstrations of hostility from the people
and Government of Japan than did the Ma-san-po incident.
Nam-pu, which it was then Russia’s object to secure, is about
twenty miles outside the limits of the treaty port of Ma-san-po.
While the Japanese Government could not prevent Russia
from obtaining a coaling-station for the Russian Steamship
Company within the boundaries of the foreign settlement of
Ma-san-po, she most strenuously protested against a grant of
land for Russian naval purposes twenty miles away. Japan
likewise resists the establishment of a Russian naval depôt
at Ching-kai-wan, where there is no treaty port, and to
which, were the “lease” confirmed, only Russia would have
a right of access.</p>

<p>Ching-kai-wan is within a few hours’ steam of that Port
Hamilton which Great Britain was induced to relinquish,
upon the understanding between Russia and China that
Russia would not seek to acquire territory in Korea. The
excuse, since put forward by Russia for the flagrant violation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
of this compact, is that it was a bargain made with China,
and not with us. There is another, and still more extraordinary
feature in connection with this affair, which
Li Hung Chang confided to a diplomatic representative of
a foreign Power, at Pekin, some years ago. The Chinese
statesman admitted that the contract between China and
Russia contained a private stipulation that it should be good
for ten years only. In other words, Great Britain was led
to withdraw from Port Hamilton on the pretence that
Russia would never trespass on Korean soil, although there
was a secret understanding between China and Russia at
the time, that this arrangement should only be in force for
one decade.</p>

<p>Although the position of affairs in regard to the action
of Russia at Yong-an-po is of recent prominence, the
question goes back in reality to the autumn of 1896, when
a Russian merchant in Vladivostock, M. Brünner by name,
obtained from the Korean Government the right of felling
lumber and planting trees on the banks of the Yalu and
Tumen Rivers, as well as on the island of Ul-lyang, for
twenty years. The concession was to be forfeited unless
work was begun in five years. As the close of the period
drew near, the Russian agent in Seoul applied for an extension
of three years. At the moment it was reported in
Seoul that this request of M. Pavloff had been refused, but
it transpired subsequently that an agreement had been
drawn up to the following effect between the superintendent,
appointed by the Korean Government to oversee
the matters, and the inspector in charge of the interests
of the company in Yong-an-po:</p>

<p>1. The said district in Yong-an-po shall be rented to the
Russian company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>2. The boundaries of the said district shall be defined by
the Russian Minister and the Minister in charge of the
Foreign Office of the Korean Government.</p>

<p>3. The Russian company shall pay a land-tax to the
Korean Government.</p>

<p>4. If the owners of tombs within this district wish to
remove them, the expense of removal shall be borne by
the Russian company.</p>

<p>5. If the company wish to utilise wood which Koreans
have cut and are bringing down the river, it must reimburse
the owners with a fair and proper price.</p>

<p>6. The Russian company shall not raise any stock
within this district except what is to be used therein.</p>

<p>7. Korean offenders within this district shall be dealt
with by the Korean courts. Russian offenders shall be
dealt with by Russian civil officers.</p>

<p>These contracts were signed on July 20th, 1903, by the
Korean official Cho Sung-hyup and the Russian Inspector
Bojisco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A CHINESE ENCAMPMENT</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, in May 1903, prior to the decision
of the Korean Government in the matter, the prefect of
Wi-ju reported the concentration of Russian troops at
An-tung for the purpose of crossing the Yalu. A few days
later, a detached party of forty of these men crossed the
stream, halting on a small island in mid-river to discard their
uniforms, so that they might enter Yong-an-po in private
clothes. From Yong-an-po they moved to Yong-chyön,
near Wi-ju, where, accompanied by one hundred Chinese
and eighty Koreans, they founded a lumber settlement,
buying seventeen houses, with twelve acres of land attached,
in the name of two of their Korean <i>employés</i>.
The presence of the colony was at once objected to by the
Korean Government, who threatened M. Pavloff with the
rupture of relations if the settlement were not at once
withdrawn. M. Pavloff, however, defended the existence
of the lumber camp under powers obtained from the
Forest Concession of 1896, which, in actuality, had not
been re-affirmed at the moment. Early in the next month,
June, the magistrate at Yong-chyön reported that another
party of Russians had arrived at Yong-an-po, including in
all three Russian women, thirty-six men, two hundred
Chinese, and many horses. These were reinforced in July by
three women and sixty men, for the most part carrying rifles
and swords, and who, also, at once bought houses and land.</p>

<p>The action of these people has assumed a specific
direction. A few, as though anxious to give colour to their
existence as a lumber settlement and in defiance of orders
from the Korean local officials, while quite exceeding the
clauses of the concession proper, persisted in felling trees
on the areas of a prohibited reserve. Meantime the remainder
of the party, by no means idle, began the construction
of a bund on the Yalu extending over a distance of
twenty-one miles, a light railway being laid down for the
purpose. In addition to this work developments of a more
permanent character were taken in hand; stone buildings
appeared, a factory was constructed, and extensive defensive
measures adopted. To confirm these indications of Russian
occupation of the Yalu reaches, a body of seventy soldiers
crossed the river at Cho-san, a second party of eighty men
coming over at Pyök-tong. The Russians then proceeded
to bring these various scattered “lumber” settlements, into
communication, for this purpose erecting a telegraph line
between Wi-ju and Yong-an-po. This line, however, the
Koreans at once cut down, whereupon the Russians began
to lay a submarine cable from Yong-an-po round the coast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
and up the Yalu River to An-tung in place of the line
across country from Yong-an-po to Manchuria. Since the
cable projects were important and, together with the settlement
at Yong-an-po, much in need of protection, Russia
proposed to draft a force of three hundred soldiers into the
place. At this date, towards the end of August, the settlement
at Yong-an-po had grown into sixty houses with a civil
Russian population of seventy citizens. By this time, however,
the Japanese Minister at Seoul, Mr. Hayashi, had
received the text of the proposed contract between the
Korean Government and the Russian Lumber Company.
Thereupon, on August 25th, he delivered an ultimatum to
the Korean Government. On the same day the Russian
Minister went to the Foreign Office and urged that the
lease of Yong-an-po be granted. In spite of his urgent
appeal, the Minister declared it to be impossible. On
the 27th the Russian Minister went again to the Foreign
Office at noon, and remained till seven in the evening, but
the Minister was ill and did not put in an appearance. The
Russian Minister then stated that he would have nothing
more to do with the Foreign Minister, but would appeal
directly to the Emperor. In his despatch Mr. Hayashi
wrote that if the Korean Government were to sign such
a lease with the Russian Government, Japan would consider
such an act as a direct violation of the treaty between
herself and Korea. In this event Japan would consider
that diplomatic relations between the two countries were
suspended, and she would regard herself free to act for
herself in her own interests on the assumption that the whole
of the Korean territories had been opened to the world.</p>

<p>The spirited action of the Japanese Minister was not lost
upon the Korean Government, who at once issued orders to
the prefect of Yong-an-po to restrain the Russians from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
further encroachment. The efforts of the local officials
were, however, of little avail, and by the middle of September,
in addition to the colony at Yong-an-po, the settlement
at Yong-chyön had increased to one hundred and twenty-eight
Chinese huts, with thirteen hundred Chinese, seventy
Russians, and twenty tents. Complaints of the high-handed
action of the Russians in appropriating the property of the
Koreans to their own needs began to arrive in Seoul, and
on September 13th came the information that a telegraph line
had again been laid between Yong-an-po and the lumber
concession on the Yalu. Coupled with the intelligence of
this renewed activity was additional, and much more disquieting,
information. The Russians had constructed on
the elevated ground about the Tu-ryu Harbour a high
watch-tower, and were preparing emplacements for three
batteries of field artillery. Meanwhile, however, as a counter
demonstration to the movement of a company of five hundred
Russians under two officers, on October 23rd, who had
crossed the Tumen River into Korean territory by night, a
Japanese warship dropped anchor in the estuary of the
Yalu, in close proximity to Yong-an-po.</p>

<p>I make no apology to my readers for giving in this
detailed fashion the history of this little Russian concession.
As a chapter of contemporary history I cannot think that
my words are of any value, but there are doubtless many
who, like myself, prefer to begin in the beginning, and so
slowly trace through the developments of any question. In
respect of Russian action on the Yalu, therefore, I have
endeavoured to do this.</p>

<p>By the wayside—A journey inland to Tong-ko-kai—Inland
beauties</p>

</div>

<p>The world of politics in Seoul had become of a sudden
so profoundly dull, that, ignoring the advice of the weather-wise
inhabitants of the capital, I packed my kit, and hiring
ponies, interpreters and servants, moved from the chief
walled city of the Empire into the wild regions of the
interior. My journey lay towards Tong-ko-kai, the German
mines, several days’ journey from Seoul. Life, in the
capital, is not destitute of that monotony which characterises
the Land of the Morning Radiance. But beyond
the precincts of the Imperial Palaces, out of sight and
hearing of the countless little coteries of Europeans, the
contrast between the moving, soft-robed, gentle masses of
people who congregate within her gates, and the mountain
reaches and valleys of the open country is refreshing. For
the moment the pleasure of such an experience ranks high
among the joys which life holds.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BEYOND THE CAPITAL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Save in the first few <i>li</i> from the capital, we abandoned
the beaten tracks, travelling along quiet byways and mountain
paths, turning aside at fancy to climb a peak or to take a
swim in the cool, deep waters of some secluded pool at
night, and morning, and at our noonday halt. In the pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
shades of these cool mountains and sunlit valleys the people
live in unrebuked simplicity. They offered the loan of
charcoal stoves
or retailed eggs,
chickens and rice
to my servants.
At the moment of
my bath, youths
and youngsters
gambolled with
me in the stream.
It is said that the
Koreans are far
from clean, a
statement they
belied upon many
occasions by the
freedom and enjoyment
with
which they indulged
in these
dips. Foreigners
had not penetrated
along the route which my friend and I were following
to the German mines, and even the ubiquitous evangelist
had not penetrated to these peasant homes. The mountains
and rivers had no names; the settlements were small; inns
did not exist. Everywhere was contentment, peace, and
infinite repose. Nature stood revealed to us in primæval
grandeur, and it was impossible not to enjoy the calm of
the valleys, the rugged beauty of the mountain crests, the
picturesque wildness of the scenery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>As the days passed the general character of the country
remained unaltered. The manifold and complex tints in
the bush, the differing aspects of each succeeding height,
the alternating complexion of the valleys, dissipated the
monotony, engendered by the never changing features of
the picture—the trees and mountains, hillside hamlets and
mountain torrents, precipitous passes and windy plateaux.
Moving thus slowly through the mountain passes, a wonderful
panorama silently disclosed itself. Hills were piled one
upon another, gradually merging into chains of mountains,
the crests of which, two and three thousand feet in height,
stood out clearly defined against an azure sky, their rock-bound
faces covered with birch, beech, oak and pine. The
valleys below these mountain chains were long and narrow,
cool and cultivated. A hillside torrent dashed through
them, tumbling noisily over massive boulders, gradually
fretting a new course for itself in the lava <i>strata</i>. Countless
insects buzzed in the still air; frogs croaked in the marsh
meadows; the impudent magpie and the plebeian crow
choked and chattered indignantly among the branches of
the trees. Cock-pheasants started from the thick cover of
the low-lying hills, the dogs pointed the nests of the sitting
hens, and does called to their calves among the young bushes.
A calm and happy nature revealed itself spontaneously in
these fragrant places, undisturbed, luxurious, and unrestrained.
The road was rough. Here and there, in keeping
with the wild and rugged beauty of the scene, it became
the narrow track of the Australasian “backs,” congested
with bushes, broken by holes and stones, almost impassable
until the coolies made a way.</p>

<p>Across the clattering crystal of the gushing torrent a
rustic bridge was flung, the merest makeshift, three feet in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
width, with a flooring of earth and bush, which bent and
swayed upon slender poles, beneath the slightest burden.
Some streams were unbridged, and the diminutive ponies
splashed through them, gladly cooling their sweating flanks
as their drivers waded or carried one another to the distant
bank. Wild ferns, butterflies, and flowers revelled in these
unkempt gardens. The red dog-lily and purple iris glowed
against the foliage of the shrubs and bushes. Gigantic
butterflies eclipsed the glories of the rainbow; their gorgeous
tints blending into harmony with the more subdued plumage
of the cranes and storks that floated lazily across the inundated
spaces of the paddy-fields. Other birds, with dove-grey,
pink, or yellow breasts and black pinions, fished in
the streams with raucous cries. The most amazing tints,
recalling some of Turner’s later pictures, gladdened the eye
in these delightful valleys. In the depths of the valleys the
mountain torrents flowed more idly, and the stream meandered
in a thousand directions. Upon either bank, its
volume was diverted to the needs of some adjacent rice-field.
In these paddy-patches green and tender shoots
were just sprouting above a few inches of clear water.
Here and there, fields of wheat bordered these water-soaked
stretches; oats, corn, barley, tobacco, cotton, beans
and millet were scattered about the sides and plains of the
mountain valleys in a fashion which proclaimed the fertility
of the soil.</p>

<p>Everything throve, however, and the industry of the
workers in the fields was manifested at every turn of the
road. Their ingenuity in making the most of available land
recalled the valleys which run down to the fiords of Norway,
where, as in Korea, patches of cultivated ground are visible
at the snow level. Here, in these beautiful valleys, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
a thousand or fifteen hundred feet up the mountain side,
acres of golden crops will be growing in the warm and
happy seclusion of some sheltered hollow.</p>

<p>At the turn of the winding track, bordered by the paddy-fields
or acres of golden barley, oats and tobacco, lies a
village. It is but a cluster of some dozen straw-thatched
hovels, dirty and unprepossessing, but infinitely quaint and
picturesque. The walls of the houses are crumbling and
stayed up with beams and massive timbers; the latticed
windows are papered, the doorways low. A hole in the
wall serves the purposes of a chimney; a dog is sleeping
in the porch; a pig squeaks, secured with a cord through
the ears to a peg in the wall. Cocks and hens are anywhere
and everywhere, the family latrine—an open trough, foul
and nauseous, used without disgust by all members of the
family save the older women-folk, stands upon the verandah.
Somewhere, near the outer limits of the small settlement,
an erection of poles and straw matting distinguishes the
village cesspool, the contents of which are spread over the
fields in the proper season.</p>

<p>A glimpse into a house, as one rides through the village
shows a man combing his long hair, a woman beating her
husband’s clothes or ironing with a bowl heated with charcoal;
many naked children, the progeny of child-wives,
scarce out of their teens. For the moment the village
seems devoid of life. As the clatter of the cavalcade resounds,
a child, feeding itself from a basin of rice, emerges
from a window; a man tumbles to his feet yawning noisily.
Women, with infants hanging at their breasts or bearing
children strapped to their backs in dirty clothes, the usual
naked band of well-developed breast and unwashed back
showing, crowd into the streets. All eye the newcomers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
with indifferent curiosity, until we wish them a plenteous
rain—“May the rain come soon, good people.” Then they
bend their heads respectfully at the salutation, and instantly
become bright and smiling. Winsome kiddies, muddy and
naked, offer us flowers, and bowls of water from the streams
upon which their elders have settled.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus57" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus57.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>COUNTRY CARTS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As the road threaded through the mountains, long
valleys, widely and richly cultivated, the yellow lustre of
the golden crops blazing in the sunlight, lay below. Granite
peaks towered upwards, their rugged faces scored by time
and tempest, their ragged outlines screened with firs and
birch. The still air was laden with the aromatic scent
of the pine-woods; the sky was clear and blue. In the
distance, snow-white clouds hung in diaphanous festoons
about a curve in the mountains. The rough contour broke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
where the heights were bleakest and most barren. A twist
in the broad valley which our road traversed limited the
prospect, but the direction lay beneath the shadows of those
distant peaks, and the perspective already compensated for
the precipitous climb.</p>

<p>Indeed, from a few <i>li</i> beyond Chyök-syöng, a magistracy
of the fourth class, where the houses are roofed with thick
slabs of slate supported by heavy beams, where the streets
are clean, and where road and river alike make a <i>détour</i>, the
views by the wayside became increasingly impressive. For
mile upon mile we saw no wayfarers. The villages were
widely distant; fertile valleys gave place to green-black
gorges, without cultivation, peaceful, grandly beautiful, and
uninhabitable. The perfect stillness and the wonderful magnificence
of the panorama held one spell-bound. There was
no change in the character of the scenery until, riding slowly
forward, the road dropped from the comfortable shade of
a mountain temple into the blazing sunshine of the plain.
Pushing forward, the rice and cornfields receded, giving
place to the ranges, whose lofty peaks, dressed with their
mantling clouds, had been already dimly discerned. Throughout
the journey of the next two days the road rose and fell,
winding in a steady gradient across the mountain sides.</p>

<p>The march to Tong-ko-kai was laborious, and one day,
when within easy distance of the concession in a tiny
hamlet, the colour of the slate and granite boulders, nestling
among waving bushes, almost unconscious of the outer
world and hardly alive to its own existence, an ideal spot in
which to pitch the evening camp was found. It was early
in the afternoon, but the road ahead looked rough and
stony. Our horses were fatigued, the ford had been troublesome
and we were wet, cold and hungry. Within the bush<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
the shadows were deepening. No one knew the site of the
next village nor the precise direction in which we were
moving, so we halted. That night we snuggled down with
our faces to the cliffs. Our horses were tethered in a patch
of corn, and the kit, the servants, interpreters and grooms
lay in one confused and hungry tangle round us. Within
sound of the deep roar of the river we slept peacefully.
Indeed, I am not certain that this one hour when, invigorated
by a swim in some mountain pool, refreshed by a slight
repast, we rocked in our camp beds, smoking and chatting,
looking into the cool black depths of the canopy above
us, was not the best that the day held. There was something
intensely restful in those long, silent watches. The
mighty stillness of the surrounding heights of itself gave a
repose, to which the night winds, the murmurs of the running
water and our own physical fatigue, insensibly added. It
was pleasant to hear the ponies eating; to watch the stars
come out, the moon rise; to listen to the bull-frog in the
water weeds and the echoes of the song of a peasant, rising
and falling among the peaks of the high mountains, until, at
length, all sounds had passed away and the great world
around us, above us, and below, lay at peace.</p>

<p>The German mines—Mineralogy and methods of mining—A
bear hunt—With gun and rifle</p>

</div>

<p>Nature has been active in these regions. There is much
limestone and slate formation, some basaltic upheavals, lava
boulders, and chain upon chain of granite peaks. To the
west of Tong-ko-kai there is the crater of an extinct volcano,
but the lava <i>strata</i> in the vicinity of the concession are
almost completely eroded. The basin of the concession
is well watered, cultivated, and populous in places. It is
surrounded by ranges three, four and five thousand feet in
height. Korea is very mountainous in the north and hilly
in the south. The watershed between the Sea of Japan and
the Yellow Sea extends north and south, nearly parallel
to the east coast. In a sense this line of mountain ranges is
the backbone of the peninsula; the eastern side of the
main watershed is narrow and abrupt, while the western is
more extended and contains low plains, favourable to agriculture.
The general altitude of the peaks varies between
five and six thousand feet. A few isolated points in the
extreme north are believed to be higher.</p>

<p>The principal mining districts are situated along the
courses of the main and the minor watersheds. The famous
mining districts of Kang-kyöi, Kap-san, and Teh-chang-chin, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
present in the occupation of native workmen, occur upon
the plateau formed by the junction of the range, which
constitutes the northern frontier of the province of Pyöng-an,
with the main watershed of the country. The British mines
at Eun-san are situated in country pierced by the north-western
antilles of the main watershed. The position of
the German mines bears a similar relation to the great
natural division of the country, upon its eastern side. Many
useful minerals are distributed over Korea—gold, silver,
lead, copper, iron, coal—but that which yields the richest
harvest is gold. The value of the gold exported from
Korea during 1901 increased from £363,305 in 1900 to
£509,738. A further increase marks 1902, the value of the
gold exported being £516,961. These figures give only the
value declared at the Customs. Large amounts are annually
smuggled out of the country.</p>

<p>The presence of gold has been known from the earliest
times. Knochenhauer, a German geologist, has declared it to
exist in every river in the kingdom. Hitherto, alluvial gold
has been the principal yield to native workers. The miners
followed the object of their search up the mountain side
until they struck veins and lodes, whence much of the
alluvial gold was derived. The chief auriferous districts are
in the northern half of the country; in which sphere lie the
American mine at Un-san, the British mine at Eun-san,
and the German mine at Tong-ko-kai.</p>

<p>The original source of Korean gold may be found in the
quartz veins, which, in the case of the American mines, is
alleged to give exceptionally rich returns. The alluvial
deposits, brought down from the veins in the mountain-ridges,
have been freely worked by Koreans; and when
more scientifically treated the yield is satisfactory. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
schotter sediments, in the case of the Tong-ko-kai mines,
attained a maximum of seventy-five feet in depth, a
thickness of sedimentary matter some fifty feet in excess
of the usual formation. The concession was granted
in 1898. Under it powers were given to a German company
to select a place twenty miles long and thirteen
miles wide, within two years from the date of signing
the contract, for the purpose of working all minerals
during a space of twenty-five years, with an annual payment
to the Korean Government of twenty-five per cent.
on the net profits. The revenues received from these contracts
belong to the Imperial Household, passing directly
into the private purse of the Sovereign. In the case of the
English syndicate, the percentage was compounded for
a sum of £20,000 and an annual payment of a further
£2000.</p>

<p>The site, which the Germans selected for their concession,
was, at the moment when they assumed control over the
areas, the centre of extensive alluvial workings. The native
miners strongly objected to the innovation, and prepared to
resist the rights of the German company by force. In the
end, however, their hostility was overcome by granting
them twelve months’ additional occupation of their works,
and, when Herr Bauer assumed charge as administrative
engineer, opposition was already at an end. The district
is covered with the remains of old workings in the schotter
of the river-bed; they are also to be found in a few places
in the quartz upon the mountain side. In the absence of
the requisite machinery, work upon the concession was
necessarily disorganised. Eventually the concession was
abandoned, close investigation failing to disclose its possession
of any very remunerative qualities. At the time of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
withdrawal, the company employed nine Europeans, thirteen
Japanese and Chinese, and some three hundred Koreans.</p>

<p>Korean mining is very elementary. The usual methods
are “placer” and “crushing” and a process of treatment
by fire. A vertical shaft is sunk, with narrow steps cut into
its sides, to the level of the reef; the bottom of the shaft is
then packed with wood, which is ignited and kept burning
for several days. The heated rock becomes very friable
and yields readily to the crude implements of the miners.
There is great competition to secure the bottom pitch in
these shafts; the more intrepid rarely delay their descent
until the working has cooled. The quartz is sometimes
rubbed to powder and the gold washed out, or it is crushed
between huge boulders, washed, re-crushed and panned
again. The gold is then picked out. Until lately there
were no places where the gold was tested by other than
the most antiquated methods.</p>

<p>Such sanguine hopes have been raised as to the results
of the mining in Korea, that it would be as well if the public
accepted all statements in regard to these investments with
great caution. The results of the development of the
various mining concessions, now in progress, will be awaited
with much interest, and will, it is to be hoped, form a
reliable test of the mining possibilities of the country. The
returns from the American mines encourage the belief that
these possibilities have not been over-estimated; but it has
yet to be proved that mining operations can be profitably
carried on with Western methods and appliances. The
deposits in which gold is found in Korea are irregular, and
by no means continuous. To a Korean miner this is of
small importance. His outfit costs at the most a few
shillings, and his belongings are easily transported to any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
distance as circumstances demand. A different order of
things is essential to a successful installation of Western
machinery, and the public require some proof that there is,
within workable distance, a sufficient quantity of ore to
yield a fair profit on their investments. This has yet to be
proved in the case of the British mine; in respect of the
German concession, the business resulted in a fiasco. That
these mining enterprises should be successful is desirable in
the interests of both natives and foreigners. They afford
steady employment at a fair wage to thousands of Koreans,
at least, part of whose earnings is expended in the purchase
of foreign goods. It is perhaps, however, not altogether
unfortunate that the Korean Government is averse, at
present, to grant further concessions.</p>

<p>During our halt at Tong-ko-kai, one day was spent in
climbing the mighty peaks to lofty spots where, at a height of
some thousands of feet, native prospectors were driving into
the granite facing of the mountain in an effort to strike the
main reef. Another day was passed in a hunt across the crests
of the ranges after bear and deer. At daybreak, a little
after 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> upon the morning of this excursion, Herr Bauer
escorted us to a prospector’s hut in the damp recesses of a
distant valley, where our beaters, gun-carriers, and hunter-guides
had been ordered to rendezvous for a bear hunt.
Alas! the Korean cannot bestir himself! His late rising
on this occasion delayed our departure from the hut two
hours. The sun had risen when the expedition moved off,
a motley retinue of professional hunters and beaters accompanying
us to the gorge, wherein lay the bear. Hunters
and beaters attached themselves to each of us, and we proceeded
across the mountain, pursuing a narrow and broken
rack, which cleft the bare summit of the highest ridges.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
We climbed and scrambled up and down and in and out of
many sheltered and well-timbered gorges, until the hunters
warned us that we were approaching our stations.</p>

<p>The beaters disappeared, making a <i>détour</i> of some <i>li</i>, to
beat up the many crooked twists and turns which the drive
took. Hours passed while we, hot, hungry, and athirst, lay
hidden in the rank bush awaiting a sight of the quarry.
For the first hour no sound broke the serenity of the valley;
presently, however, the cries of the beaters came to us,
wafted from below or floating lazily from the surrounding
heights. At first only a distant moaning, like the sobbing of
a storm among the trees of a forest, broke upon our ears.
The strange sounds created much restlessness among the
wild wood-pigeons, the cooing doves, and the cheery,
chattering magpies. Red-breasted storks rose with disdainful
elegance from the shallows of the trickling stream and
soared towards other pools. The mists of night rolled away
from the valley; the dew disappeared from the matted
undergrowth; the sun mounted; the day grew warmer.
The blood coursed through our veins as we peered hither
and thither, scanning the opposite face of the valley with
the keenest vigilance. The beaters were ascending. The
harsh cries of their raucous voices broke upon the air.
The air vibrated with eerie noises; a spasmodic howling
arose from the depths of the valley, where an isolated
beater lashed himself into a fever of vociferous discord.
Hoarse shouts boomed above us, and echoed against the
crags of the gorge. On either side of us, the valley resounded
to the labours of the beaters, who, gaining the
extreme crests, had now descended, driving everything
before them. They approached rapidly, joined by the
native hunters, who had now taken up positions upon the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
rocks which overlooked the place where we were hiding.
Our own moment had arrived. Each man fingered his
rifle, peering forward as the concluding effort of the beaters
burst forth in a hurricane of clamour. We looked and
waited, until the conclusion was forced upon us that the
bear had already long since broken through the lines of
his pursuers.</p>

<p>Hunting in general is considered a servile occupation by
the Koreans, and the pursuit of the deer, the bear, and the
tiger is not a favourite sport among the young bloods of the
kingdom. Nobles, except those who belong to a few
impoverished families in the extreme northern provinces,
and who are reduced to the pastime to supplement their
resources, never indulge in it. It is, nevertheless, free to
all. There are no game laws, no proscription of arms, and
few preserves. There is no interdicted season in any part of
the country. The one creature which it is forbidden to
destroy is the falcon, whose life is protected by most
stringent enactments. The hunting-grounds are almost
solely confined to the mountainous districts, and the hunters
are a class apart throughout the country. They shift their
grounds rapidly and constantly in search of game, living at
the expense of any village where they may temporarily
lodge in return for the protection from wild animals
which their prowess assures to the local population. Their
chief weapon is the flint-lock, imported from Japan. The
barrel is inlaid with silver, and bound with thin silver bands
or strips of tin. This weapon is loaded with iron bullets,
similar in size to those contained in a seven-pound shrapnel
shell. The charge is ignited from a coil of plaited straw-cord,
which is kept alight during the progress of the hunt.
The stock is short and light. When the gun is fired, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
butt of this curious and antique weapon rests against the
cheek-bone. The faces of many of the hunters, who accompanied
us, were scarred below the right eye.</p>

<p>Their dress is characteristic, and they are further distinguished
by their boldness, fearlessness, and independent
bearing. They adopt, as a uniform, a blue canvas shirt, to
which is added a blue or green cotton turban, which is
coiled twice through the hair, the torn, frayed end hanging
over the forehead. Coloured beads are entwined in this
head-dress, and a necklace of similar beads encircles the
throat. Chains of seed-beans hang across the breast, to
which are fastened the many ingenious contrivances of their
calling. The hunters imitate the sounds of various birds
and animals very cleverly, particularly those of a pheasant
calling to his hen and a doe crying to her calves. The
pheasant-call is made from a disc of iron about the size of
a sixpenny piece. It resembles the stone of an apricot and
is pierced. The decoy used for deer is made from a split
bamboo stalk.</p>

<p>Bird-hunters never shoot their quarry upon the wing.
They disguise themselves in skins or feathers, bringing
down their game from some well-concealed coign of
vantage. Deer are hunted during June and July. The
hunters form into small parties, and beat up the mountains
for several days until their prey is within gunshot. The
horns are sold to the native physicians, or exported to
China and Japan. When in pursuit of the bear, hunters
are more than usually careful to delay firing until the effect
of their shot is certain. Good prices are fetched by the
various parts of a bear. In addition to the proceeds from
the pelt, the flesh, fat, sinews and gall of a bear, supposed
to possess certain medicinal properties, sell for their weight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
in silver. The one royal quadruped associated with Korea,
as the white elephant is with Siam, the dromedary with
Egypt, the bison with the United States, is the tiger.
Unlike the Indian species, that delights in the tropical
jungles, this animal is found in Korea in the snow and
forests of the north, and as far as the fiftieth parallel. In
the mind of the Korean, the tiger is the symbol of fierceness,
an emblem of martial pomp and glory. The tiger hunters
affect to despise their noble game, and upon occasions they
even attack them single-handed with a lance or short sword,
assisted by trained dogs. Tigers are sometimes caught in
pits, covered with earth and bushes, and filled with stakes.
In this condition it is easy to kill them. The hunters eat
the meat, selling the skin and bones.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A SUMMER PLEASAUNCE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Tiger hunters are exceptionally courageous. Their
services are requisitioned by their Government upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
occasion in the defence of the Empire. Armed with matchlock,
spear and sword, they defeated the French, under
Admiral Roze, in 1866, and heroically resisted the advance
of the Americans in 1871. In 1901 they were assembled to
protect the northern frontier from the incursions of Manchurian
bandits.</p>

<p>The monks and monasteries of the Diamond Mountains—The
Temple of Eternal Rest—The Temple of the Tree of
Buddha—Buddhism</p>

</div>

<p>Game abounds in the region between the German mines
and the Diamond Mountains, and as we moved slowly
forward to the famous Monastery of Chang-an, many
short halts were made in search of birds and deer. Unfortunately,
the deer evaded us and it became impossible to
put up the pheasants out of the dense growth in the bushes
in which they found cover. We had, however, some sport
among the wood-pigeon. Korean hunters accompanied us
some little distance upon our journey, leaving our caravan
when our ways diverged. Beyond the Hai-yong River
their track lay to the west into the heart of the mountains;
our own continued north-east.</p>

<p>The hardships, experienced in travelling through Korea,
were exemplified by the difficulties of our progress. They
were intensified, however, by our ignorance of the precise
trail, which it was necessary to follow across the heights
from Tong-ko-kai to the mountain retreat of the pious
monks. The inhabitants of the village of To-chi-dol warned
our grooms of the difficulty of taking horses across the
Tan-bal-yang Pass, the one barrier, which remained unsurmounted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
between the outside world and the quiet repose of
the first monastery in the Keum-kang-san. Until we enforced
our orders with sticks the <i>mampus</i> were inclined to
give up the enterprise. Their opposition was momentary;
the transition from a somewhat angry mood into their usual
condition of unruffled
composure
and high spirits
was instantaneous.
With untiring
energy and
patience they encouraged
their
diminutive ponies
to climb the boulders;
to twist and
wriggle between
the clumps of
tangled bushes
and masses of
rock which beset
the path, and to
scramble across the steeps. We followed a dried-up water-course
at the level of the valley, making the ascent gradually.
The climb was severe, and became so steep that the pack-saddles
slipped off the backs of the ponies. It occupied our
eight animals some four hours, testing the endurance of
pony and groom, alike the product of the hills, stout of
limb and strong of wind.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp63" id="illus60" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus60.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE ABBOT OF CHANG-AN-SA</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The descent from the spirit shrine, in a gap on the crest
of the range, was less toilsome. The grooms plaited ropes
of green creepers, plucked from the bush, and strung them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
round the packs. Walking behind the ponies, they held to
these cords, thus supporting the animals and preventing the
loads and clumsy saddles from reversing the process of the
previous scramble. Nevertheless, our path was littered
with fragments of our baggage. The contrivance was
successful, however, and in the main the little steeds picked
their way with an easy accuracy through the cool green
woods. The mountain side was fragrant with innumerable
plants, the bush a tangle of magnificent ferns, trees, and
shrubs. Oaks, hawthorn, chestnut, birch and pines grew
in crowded splendour; the wild rose, the freckled lily, and
a purple orchid embroidered the moss. Beyond the hollows
of the hilly woodlands, the crumpled backs of the jagged
mountains reared themselves skyward, their proud crests
lost in the clouds, soaring silently to a height of five
thousand feet. Below in the valley, a wall of granite
mountains set up an impenetrable barrier before a noisy
river, which until the advent of the rainy season becomes
the merest trickle of silver in a lone expanse of river-bed.</p>

<p>Our way lay across the river-bed and thence into the
centre of the mountains, a journey of one more day, to The
Temple of Eternal Rest. After crossing the Tan-bal-yang
Pass we delayed, resting at Kal-kan-i. Starting at daybreak,
upon the next morning we moved through the Kak-pi
Pass as the sun touched the tops of the mountains, which
shut in the narrow valley, across which lay the last stage of
the journey. We were nearing the last home of many
distressed pilgrims. In a cleft among the mountains the
deep curved roofs of many temples might be seen. The
air was tremulous with the pleasant jangling of bells, and
from a wayside shrine the sweet fumes of incense mingled
with the scent of the pines. The calm and seclusion of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
spiritual retreat was in itself soothing; as one passed beneath
the red gate, that indicates royal patronage, the placid
gentleness of the scene was an allurement to the consolation
and protection offered by this Buddhistic asylum.</p>

<p>There are thirty-four monasteries, and monastic shrines
in the Keum-kang-san, and they are tended by three
hundred monks and sixty nuns. Chang-an is the oldest,
and has been in existence for some generations. In 515 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
during the reign of Po-pheung, a king of Silla, it was restored
by two monks, Yul-sa and Chin-kyo. Other monasteries,
akin to this in their romantic setting and picturesque seclusion,
are Pyo-un, which, together with Chang-an is situated
upon the western slopes, Yu-chom and Sin-ga upon the eastern
slopes. These, with thirty others of less importance, excite
the most profound interest and enthusiasm among the
Koreans, many of whom repeatedly brave the difficulties
and fatigues of travel in the Diamond Mountains to visit
them.</p>

<p>The four chief monasteries are served by one hundred
and seventy monks and thirty nuns. The main temple of
Chang-an is a large building, forty-eight feet in height, of
the type to which travellers in the East soon become accustomed.
The wooden structure is rectangular with two roofs,
deep, curved and richly carved eaves, the heavy tiled roofs
being supported upon teak pillars three feet in circumference.
The diamond-cut panels of the doors, which serve as windows,
are ornamented with gold, and the lofty ceiling is carved and
wrought in rich designs, lavishly gilded and highly coloured
in blue, red, green and gold. Granite steps give access to
the temples; the main beams and supports of the whole
edifice resting upon huge circular slabs of this stone.</p>

<p>On the inner walls of this building there are scenes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
from the life of Gautama, the apostle of the Buddhistic
creed. A gilded image figures as the centre of a golden
group of seven past and future godheads, incarnations
of the One and sublime Sakya-muni, whose future reappearance
is anticipated by the faithful. Brass incense-burners,
candlesticks, and a manuscript book of masses in
Chinese and Korean characters, resting upon a faded cover
of soiled and dusty brocade, furnish the front of the altar.
Before this high altar, wonderfully impressive and inspiring
in the dim religious light of the vast interior, a priest spends
certain hours of the day and night in profound obeisance,
intoning, chanting and gabbling monotonously and with
constant genuflections, the words <i>Na-mu Ami Tabul</i>. This
expression is a phonetic rendering of certain Thibetan words,
the meaning of which the Abbot himself was unable to explain;
when transcribed in Chinese characters it appears
equally unintelligible.</p>

<p>Other temples in this particular monastery are dedicated
to The Abode of Virtue, The Four Sages, and The Ten
Judges. Within these edifices Sakya-muni and his disciples
sit in different attitudes of ineffable abstraction, contemplating
gruesome pictures of demons, animals, and the
torments awarded in after-life to the wicked. Many of
the buildings of Chang-an have been restored within
recent years. The work has been completed long since, and
the spacious courtyards are now well kept. The temples are
clean and spotless, the whole monastery bearing witness to
the care with which it is maintained.</p>

<p>Besides the more important temples, there are many
smaller shrines, set within some forest nook; a stage for
the more important religious observances, bell and tablet
houses, stables for the ponies of the numerous visitors, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
nunnery and a refectory for the Abbot and monks. There
are, in addition, cells for the priests and quarters for the
servants. Accommodation is found for the widows,
orphans, and the destitute; for the lame, the halt, and the
blind; for the aged and forlorn, to whom the monks grant
shelter and protection. Besides the Abbot, there were in
the monastery some twenty other men, monks, priests and
neophytes, and ten nuns of various ages, ranging from girlhood
to wrinkled wisdom.</p>

<p>The establishment derives its revenues from the rent and
proceeds of the Church lands, donations from pilgrims and
guests, occasional benefactions from the wealthy, and the
collections made by the mendicant monks. These latter chant
the litanies of Buddha from house to house, and travel
throughout the Empire, finding food and lodging by the
wayside, to collect the scanty contributions which their
solicitations evoke. The four great monasteries are presided
over by a member of the community, who is
elected annually to the office. Unless his conduct gives
rise to dissatisfaction, he is maintained in authority, usually
until his death, or transference to some other centre of
Buddhistic activity. The practices and observances, in
these monasteries of the Diamond Mountains, conform to
the principles of the religion of Buddha, as nearly as do the
customs and manners of our own Church to the varied
tenets of Christianity throughout the world.</p>

<p>I confess myself sorely puzzled to discover any substratum
of truth in the charges of gross profligacy and
irreverence which the agent of an American Missionary
Society brings against the monasteries of the Keum-kang-san.
Personally, after spending many weeks in the calm
seclusion of this monastic region, I prefer to recall the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
kindliness of the monks—their real Christian charity—to the
poor and afflicted, to the hungry and sore distressed, as to
all who come to them in times of misery and evil. If many
of them learn the litanies of their liturgy by heart, if they
lack scholarship, if they do not know the meaning of much
upon which they spend so many weary hours of their lives,
are not these slight things when weighed against their profound
humanity, their gentleness to everything which breathes,
their benevolence to the old and destitute, their exceeding
humility, their wonderful toleration, the quietness and
extreme simplicity of their lives, and the humanitarian
nature of their interests?</p>

<p>The Monastery of Yu-chom is all peace and quietude.
It lies, shut off from all contact with the outer world, within
a deep, tree-clad valley of the eastern ranges. It is self-contained,
and its whole existence is wrapped up in the
mysteries of that faith to whose services it is dedicated.
There is no booming torrent, such as that which vibrates
and thunders through the Chang-an-sa gorge; a subdued
babble alone rises from the water, which wells from some
rocks deep in the recesses of the prevailing bush. Its
appearance is strangely solemn, and it exerts over the daily
lives of the coterie of monks, assembled within its walls, an
influence that conduces to their extreme asceticism. The
atmosphere of repose and seclusion, in which a soul distressed
finds so much comfort, broods over the whole
community.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE ABBOT OF YU-CHOM-SA</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The most imposing of the thirty-four Buddhist retreats
within the Diamond Mountains is Yu-chom-sa.
It may be approached from the western side of the
Keum-kang-san by climbing the rocky path of the
Chang-an-sa gorge, and crossing the watershed through
the An-man-chai Pass, 4215 feet in height. The descent
is made by a rough and picturesque track through deep
woods to the cluster of temples upon the eastern face of
the range. Another way, which, after a short <i>détour</i> from
Chang-an-sa, is an easier route, lies over the Pu-ti-chong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
Pass, 3700 feet in height; after winding through some
miles of forest, it drops directly upon a track, which leads
to the gates of the monastery. Each road starts from
Chang-an-sa, and the crossing of the mountains must be
undertaken by all who wish to visit the monasteries upon
the eastern slopes. The journey in either direction can
be accomplished within eight hours; the difficulties of the
bed of the Chang-an-sa torrent render this route impassable
to horses, &amp;c. Lightly-loaded ponies can be taken across
the Pu-ti-chong. The hire of coolies is recommended
and one Korean dollar for each man is the tariff.</p>

<p>The temples of Yu-chom-sa are very similar to those at
Chang-an-sa. They are, however, more numerous and
more richly endowed. Before the steps of the main temple
there is a small granite pagoda, whose graceful proportions
give an element of dignity to the spacious courtyard upon
which the principal temples of the monastery abut. The
altar of this temple is adorned by a singular piece of wood-carving.
Upon the roots of an upturned tree sit or stand
fifty-three diminutive figures of Buddha. The monks tell
an old-world legend of this strange structure. Many
centuries ago, fifty-three priests, who had journeyed from
India to Korea to introduce the precepts of Buddha into
this ancient land, sat down by a well beneath a spreading tree.
Three dragons presently emerged from the depths of the
well and attacked the fifty-three, calling to their aid the
wind-dragon, who thereupon uprooted the tree. As the
fight proceeded, the priests managed to place an image of
Buddha upon each root of the tree, converting the whole
into an altar, under whose influence the dragons were forced
back into their cavernous depths, when huge rocks were
piled into the well to shut them up. The monks then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
founded the monastery, building the main temple above
the remains of the vanquished dragons. Upon each side of
the fantastic altar-piece there is a carved design of lotus leaves
several feet in width and height; at the feet of an immense
image of the divine Buddha, golden and bejewelled, which
graces the centre of the shrine, are several magnificent
bronze bowls of vast size, weight, and antiquity. Blue and
red silk-gauze draperies, serving the purpose of a screen,
hang from the massive beams in the roof.</p>

<p>The figures seen in Korean temples are reproduced in
Buddhist temples throughout Asia, the supreme and central
form being that of Sakya-muni or Buddha. In the sculpture
and artistic development of this, the central figure of their
pantheon, there is little, if any, deviation from the conventional
traditions of India, Siam, Thibet, and Mongolia.
The sage is crouching on his knees with the souls of his
feet turned upward to the face; the palms and fingers of
his hands pressed together; the eyes are slightly oblique,
and the lobes of the ears somewhat bulbous. The throne
consists of the open calyx of a lotus flower, the symbol
of eternity. The splendour of the figures in the Temple of
the Tree of Buddha is noticeable; and the lustre of the
heavy gilding gleams from about the altar into the dimness
and uncertain light of the vast chamber like the rays of some
spiritual fire. Devotional exercises never cease in this
House of the Ever-Supreme Lord, the services and constant
offering of prayer being taken in turn by the officiating
priests. At these moments, when the lonely figure of the
priest is seen pleading with the Ever-Supreme Lord, in
his most sacred Temple and before his most sacred shrine,
for the grace of forgiveness, the scene is one of the most
extraordinary solemnity. As the chant rises and falls in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the great spaces of the hall and the swaying figure rocks
in the despair of his passionate self-abandonment the
sympathies and emotions are strangely stirred. The
stages of the services are marked by blows upon a
bell which the priest holds before him, the while he casts
himself upon his face and kneels before the resplendent
Buddha.</p>

<p>The chief celebrations of the day and night in Yu-chom-sa
are accompanied by the booming of the great
bronze bell—an elaborate casting of the fourteenth century—and
by the beating of a large circular drum many feet in
circumference. Both instruments stand in their own towers
in the courtyard. During the minor services, the genuflections
of the priests are accompanied by the jarring notes
of the small brass bells, which they strike repeatedly with
deer-horns. A magnificent figure of Buddha sits in the
Temple of the Lotus Blossom, in an attitude of impassive
benignity behind a screen of glass, looking solemnly upon
the devotions and pious exercises of his faithful attendants.
This altar is recessed, the entire shrine being protected by
plates of glass, and the offerings of rice, which are presented
to the altar for benediction, stand without the
screen. Among other temples and shrines at Yu-chom-sa
there are the House of Everlasting Life, the Temple
of the Water Month, the Temple of People who come
from the West. There are fifty monks in Yu-chom-sa,
twelve nuns, and eight boys who have not yet been
admitted to the order. Many of the boys in these monasteries
are quite young. Some have been handed over by
their parents in extreme infancy, while others have been
received out of the wide charity of the Buddhists, and
dedicated to the service of the monasteries. These boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
appear intelligent. They are taught little beyond the
different chants and litanies, with the words of which
they soon become familiar. The boys are clean and
well fed; but the monks, if equally clean, are more
sparing in their diet. Their frugal repast consists of rice
and varieties of minced vegetables, cakes of pine nuts glued
together with honey, and other cakes of popped rice and
honey. The extreme richness of the dishes soon palls upon
the palate. While managing to exist, signs of emaciation
are noticeable in their bodies and faces. Among the nuns
who are attracted to these different monasteries, there are
many who have entered the cloister from religious motives,
and a few who, alone in the world, find it a convenient
spot in which to pass their lives. Neither class, however,
encroaches upon the religious and devotional functions of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
the monks, but lives entirely apart, existing altogether in a
world of their own making.</p>

<p>The forms of religion which prevail in Korea to-day are
Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shamanism. Statements of
ancient Chinese and Japanese writers, and the early Jesuit
missionaries, tend to prove that the worship of spirits and
demons has been the basis of national belief since the
earliest times. The god of the hills is even now the most
popular deity. Worship of the spirits of heaven and earth,
of the invisible powers of the air, of nature, of the morning
star, of the guardian genii of the hills and rivers, and of
the soil and grain, has been so long practised that, in spite
of the influences of Confucianism, and the many centuries
in which Buddhism has existed in the land, the actual
worship of the great mass of the people has undergone
little material alteration. However widespread this leaning
of the lower classes towards demonolatry may be, the
philosophy of Confucius has been from the fifteenth
century the official and fashionable cult in Korea. In its
middle period, it attained to that point when a religion,
which at first was fostered by the few and has spread
gradually until it became absorbed by the people, feels
itself firmly established, and emphasises its ascendency by
the bigotry of its assertions, its intolerance, and, crowning
triumph of all usurping tenets, by the virulence of its
persecution. Confucianism now overspreads the whole
peninsula. From the fourth to the fourteenth century,
when the religion of the Enlightened One prevailed, it was
studied and practised only by the learned classes. Buddhism
predominated throughout the southern half of the peninsula,
and only partially leavened the northern division of the
Empire, where it was unable to combat the teachings of Confucius.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Throughout its development, however, Buddhism
has exercised a potent influence in Korean affairs, which
continued until the close of the last dynasty. The power
of the bonzes at one time controlled the Court and nullified
the decrees of the monarch. During its pristine supremacy
it became the strongest and most formidable factor in the
education of the country. It wielded unlimited and unrestricted
power, while it guided the political and social revolutions
of the period. Great respect is still shown to the
tenets of Buddhism in Korea. New monasteries and temples
are in process of construction—the Buddhist priests of Japan
and Korea making common cause against the activities of
Western missionaries. The Emperor has also shown
himself interested in the propagation of this faith, and,
with Lady Om, he has given large sums to the restoration of
certain dilapidated temples without the city. All things<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
considered, Buddhism has left such a mark upon the
history of the little kingdom that, although the purely ethical
character of the teachings of Confucius be acknowledged,
Korea must be classed among the Buddhist countries of
the earth.</p>

<p>The Abomination of desolation—Across Korea—The east
coast—Fishing and filth</p>

</div>

<p>The peace, piety, and sublime earnestness of the monks of
the monasteries of Yu-chom and Chang-an is in startling
contrast to the state of things at Shin-ki-sa. The magnificence
of Yu-chom-sa, and the charitable benevolence
of Chang-an-sa, engender a mood of sympathetic appreciation
and toleration towards those, whose lives are dedicated
to the service of Buddha, in these isolated retreats of the
Diamond Mountains. The spectacle presented by the
monastery at the north-eastern base of the Keum-kang-san,
however, reveals the existence of certain evils which happily
do not disfigure the more important Buddhist centres
in this region. It is not time which alone has brought
about the disorder; nor would the material decay be so
lamentable if the dignity and charm of a picturesque ruin
were not lacking. The tone of the monks here is totally
different. Everything is neglected, and every one is indifferent
to the needs of the temples. A litter of broken
tiles lies about the buildings; dirt and dust, the natural
consequences of carelessness and neglect, disgrace them
within. The spirit of reverence is wanting. The scene is
changed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>Shin-ki is a small monastery. Perhaps its temples have
never been comparable with the shrines of Yu-chom-sa
in grace and beauty. Nothing, however, can excuse the
disorder and neglect of its court-yards, and the slovenliness
of the temple service. There seems to be nothing in
common between this and those other monasteries, which
rest within the heart of the ranges. One looks in vain for
the courtly dignity of the aged Abbot of Yu-chom-sa, whose
humanitarian spirit was so impressive. The principles of
consideration, politeness, and devotion that govern his
conduct are sadly lacking in the Abbot, the priests, and
monks attached to Shin-ki-sa. The contrast is indeed
great. The most painful emotions are excited by the
decline which has taken place in the prosperity of the
temples. Anger and sorrow fill the soul. As one gazes
beyond the temples into the peace and beauty of the valley
below, it is as if one were looking across from a place
of abomination into another and a better world. The
colourless skeleton of the past alone remains, and one longs
for the power to restore the fabric to its former self.</p>

<p>In its setting the monastery has caught something of the
spirit of nature. If there is any compensating element in its
decadence, it is found in the wild beauty of the rugged
mountains, which tower above it from across the valley.
Beyond their granite faces lie the trials and tribulations of
the outer world; once enclosed within their grey embrace
the little ironies of life disappear. The hours are cool
and undisturbed. Primeval forests adorn the deep gullies
of the ranges; a flood of colour comes from the open
spaces where wild flowers are growing and the tints of
the woodland foliage disclose an endless variety of green.
In the centre of a patch, cleared of its undergrowth and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
approached by a path winding through deep woods, is
Mum-sa-am. This retreat is given over to the twenty nuns
who are associated with Shin-ki-sa. I know nothing of
their lives, but from the state of their temples, and the
roughness and disorder of their surroundings, it did not
appear to me that they, any more than the sixty priests,
monks, and boys of the lower monastery, find the tenets
of Buddha very elevating, or derive much satisfaction from
the surrounding scenery.</p>

<p>The history of our days in the more important monasteries
of the Diamond Mountains was uneventful. The
anxious care and solicitude of the monks for the welfare of
their guests was hourly manifested, and some kindly attention
was shown to us at every possible opportunity. Cool and lofty
quarters were allotted for our entertainment; the resources
of the monastery were placed at our disposal. The Abbot
of Chang-an-sa prepared draughts of honey-water and cakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
of pine-seeds for our refreshment. Every morning supplies
of honey, rice, and flour, and small bundles of fresh vegetables
were brought to the table; throughout the day
nothing was left undone, which, in the minds of these
simple men, would be conducive to our comfort. A deep
pool in the tumbling mountain-stream was reserved for our
use, and when, in the fresh air of the morning, and again
when the cool winds of the evening had tempered the heat
of the day, we went to bathe, the Abbot, upon his own
initiative, arranged that we should be left in undisturbed
possession of the water-hole.</p>

<p>The Temple, which we occupied during our stay at
Chang-an-sa, contained The Altar of the Three Buddhas.
The building was spacious and impressive. A wide verandah
surrounded it, teak pillars supported a massive roof; scrolls
and allegorical pictures, illustrating incidents in the life of
Buddha, decorated the wall. Layers of oiled paper carpeted
the floor; an altar cloth of silk, richly embroidered, small
mats, bronze incense bowls and brass candelabra, embellished
the altar, in the centre of which was a large gilt
image of the Three Buddhas. Every evening at sunset,
the monks who officiated in this Temple placed bowls
of rice, honey, and pine-seed cakes upon the altar, and
lighted the small lamps and candles which illuminated it.
Prayers were not always said, nor were the services always
the same, the numbers of the monks varying nightly according
to the character of the special office. When the services
concluded, there were many who found something to attract
them in our small encampment. They gathered round the
kitchen; they assisted the interpreter to cook, and tasted his
dishes. They handled with amazement the cooking utensils of
a camp-kitchen, the cutlery of a traveller’s table. Occasionally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
as their increasing familiarity brought about some
small degree of intimacy between us, the monks would
display their beads and alms-bowls for our inspection,
requesting our acceptance of copies of their books in return
for photographs of their temples. The intricacies of a
camera delighted them, the appearance of a sporting rifle
created consternation in their breasts, and they were never
tired of swinging in my camp-bed.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE ABBOT AND MONKS OF CHANG-AN-SA</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Before the camp at Chang-an-sa was shifted to
Yu-chom-sa, a fast friendship, engendered by many kindly
acts and the uninterrupted expression of a thoughtful
consideration for our needs, sprung up between the monks
and ourselves. They consulted us about their ailments,
which usually took the shape of an acute attack of indigestion
or a form of intermittent dysentery. My medicines
were limited to some quinine pills and a bottle of fruit salts;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
they accepted either prescription with gratitude and much
melancholy philosophy. But although they remained always
the same well-disposed visitors to our camp, I noted that they
did not frequently present themselves as candidates for
treatment again. When the moment came for our departure,
many small gifts were pressed upon us. For a long time,
too, it seemed as if it would be impossible to obtain an
account of our indebtedness to the monastery. In the end
the persuasion of the interpreter prevailed. When we added
to the reckoning a few dollars for the funds of the
monastery, the expressions of gratitude and appreciation,
to which our little gift gave rise, made it almost possible
to believe that the kindness and hospitality shown had been
all on our side.</p>

<p>Our quarters at Yu-chom-sa were in no sense inferior,
and none the less delightful in their situation, to those
which we left behind at Chang-an-sa. The guest-house in
Yu-chom-sa affords views of the mountain torrent as it
dashes through the boulder-strewn, tree-clad slopes of the
valley. At Chang-an-sa we camped beneath the protecting
eaves of the spacious verandah which surrounds the
Temple of The Three Buddhas, avoiding whenever possible
any general use of the sacred edifice. In the case of
Yu-chom-sa, this diffidence was unnecessary; the building
placed at our disposal being that usually set aside for
the requirements of those persons of official position who
might be visiting the monastery. The apartments were clean,
comfortable, and bright. They were hung with tablets, upon
which had been inscribed the names and dignities of
previous visitors. High walls enclosed the buildings, and
massive gates preserved the compound from unexpected
intrusion. The life in these encampments is one of ideal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
peace and happiness. It was possible to work undisturbed
and unprovoked by any harrowing influences. Indeed,
there was no suggestion of any other existence. We lived in
the seclusion of a sanctuary, where mortal misgivings had
not penetrated, and where the tribulations, which oppress
mankind, were unknown.</p>

<p>Beyond Shin-ki-sa, a journey of fifteen <i>li</i>, a well-made
road leads east north-east to the coast, which it
touches at Syöng-chik. The sight and scent of the sea, after
the exhausting discomforts of Shin-ki-sa, was peculiarly
welcome. Between Yu-chom-sa and Shin-ki-sa the
country is intersected with marshes and rice-fields. The
difficulties of marching through these bogs and mud-holes
greatly impeded the horses. The road by the coast, if
rough and stony in places, is at least free from these
obstacles, affording a tortuous, but none the less pleasant,
course. Wending across basaltic slopes, ascending their
smooth surfaces by a series of roughly-hewn steps, it drops
to a level of burnished sand. A sweep inland to the west
and south-west avoids the rugged spurs of a neighbouring
range. The sea licks the white sand with gentle murmurs
and the slight breeze scarcely ripples the blue surface, the
constant variations, which the golden sands and glittering
sea, the open valleys and green hills present, adding to the
charm and freshness of the journey. The feeling of isolation,
inseparable from travel in regions where the sense
of freedom is shut out by a world of enclosing mountains,
is at once lost in contact with the ocean and the ships that
go down to it. Far out, in the great expanse of the peaceful
sea, were fishing-boats, grey junks, hull down upon the
horizon, their brown sails bellying spasmodically in the fitful
gusts of the breeze. In the shallows off-shore men, brown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
and naked, dragged for herring and sprat while their
children gathered crabs, diving after their victims in the
deep pools with screams of delight.</p>

<p>Around the hovels, in all these clusters of small villages
by the waves, men slept in the blazing sunshine. While
their lords reposed, the women mended the rents in the
nets, or busied themselves in constructing crude traps, with
the aid of which their husbands contrived to catch fish. The
aspect of these villages upon the beach was not inviting;
and they did not compare favourably with any of the inland
villages through which we had passed. They were dirty,
tumble-down, and untidy; the appearance of the people
suggested great personal uncleanliness. The air was laden
with the smell of fish drying in the sun—of itself a pleasant
perfume, smacking of the salt of the sea—but here so
mingled with the odours of decaying offal, piles of rubbish,
and varieties of fish and seaweed in different stages of decomposition
that the condensed effluvium was sickening. The
people, however, were neither curious nor unkindly; for the
great part they were indifferent, offering baskets of fresh
eggs, fish, and chickens readily for sale. The beach by
these villages was black with rows of fish, drying, upon the
white sand, in the most primitive fashion. The art of
smoking fish is unknown, and the careless manner in which
the curing is done proves that the treatment has neither
principle nor system. Dogs lay upon these rows of fish,
fowls feed undisturbed off them, and, in many places, men
slept peacefully with a number of them heaped together,
to serve as pillows for their weary heads. Where such
neglect prevails, it is perhaps not unnatural that much of
the disease among the Koreans should be attributed to the
dried fish which they eat so greedily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>The trade in salted and sun-dried fish is extensive and
finds its way all over the kingdom; an overland traffic
of considerable importance exists with the capital. Strings
or stacks of dried fish are to be seen in every village. Pack
ponies, and coolies laden with loads of dried fish, are met
upon every road in the kingdom. The pedestrian who
“humps his own swag” almost always carries a small stock
with him. The parallel industry to the business of curing
fish is the operation of making salt from sea-water, a pursuit
which is conducted in a manner equally rough and casual.
In both of these industries there is a crying need for simple
technical instruction, as well as for capital, the lack of which
hinders the work from achieving any particular success.
There is so much fish in the sea along the coast, that, if the
catches were properly treated, the beginning of a prosperous
export trade could be readily laid. At the present only
a bare sufficiency is secured, the days of prosperity not yet
having begun to dawn. The industry is completely paralysed
by the exactions of the officials; the fishermen, like the
peasants, knowing only too well that an immunity from the
demands of the <i>Yamen</i> is found only in a condition of
extreme poverty.</p>

<p>Many fishing villages were passed through in the journey
from the Diamond Mountains. Each seemed to reflect the
other, the sole difference between them lying in their size,
the number of fishing-boats drawn up on the beach, the
strength and density of their smells. The poverty and
squalor of these hamlets was astonishing. The people
seemed without spirit, content to live an idle, slatternly
existence in sleeping, yawning, and eating by turns. Despite
offers of payment, it was impossible to secure their services
in a day’s fishing, although they generally admitted that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
boats, nets, and lines were not otherwise engaged. As the
outcome of this spirit of indifference among the natives,
Japanese fishermen are rapidly securing for themselves the
fishing-grounds off the coast. Unless these dreary, meditative,
and dirty people arouse themselves soon, the business
of fishing in their own waters will have passed altogether
from their hands. The Japanese catch fish at all seasons;
the Koreans at one only—when it suits them. They have
consequently a diminishing influence in a trade so exceedingly
profitable that some ten thousand Japanese
fishing-boats subsist by it.</p>

</figure>

<p>The filthy condition of the villages renders any stay in
them perilous. It is wiser to camp beyond them in the
open. It was my misfortune to stay in several, but in the
village of Wha-ding, seventy-five <i>li</i> from Won-san, the
virulence and variety of the insects surpassed all my experience
in Australia, America, Africa, or Asia. Fleas were
everywhere; they floated through the atmosphere, much as
the north-west winds of New Zealand and the hot winds of
Africa drive particles of fine sand through the air. In this
case, however, nothing remained without its thin penetrating
covering of fleas. One night in Wha-ding stands out as the
most awful of these experiences. It was impossible to stand;
it was impossible to sit; sleep was out of the question. We
shook our clothes; we bathed and washed and powdered.
Every effort was a torture, and each precaution increased
the ironies of the situation. To add to the plagues of this
accursed place, we were deafened by the ear-splitting incantations
of a sorcerer, who had been hired by the proprietor
of the village inn to exorcise a devil that had
bewitched him. We wondered, afterwards, whether this
accounted for the damnable activity among the vermin.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
After a futile attempt to come to terms with the magician
by bribery and corruption through the medium of my
interpreter, it was arranged that one of the grooms should
represent the evil spirit. He passed out into the desolation
of the night and howled plaintively, while we, having
collected the elders and the necromancer, solemnly fired
our revolvers into the darkness at the departing spirit.
Unfortunately, we did not convince the wizard that the
devil had been expelled. It was not until, losing my temper
and my reason together, I dropped his gongs and cymbals
down a well, depositing him in it after them, that we were
rid of the agonies of this additional nuisance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p>Drought—Starvation—Inland Disturbances—Rainfall and
disease</p>

</div>

<p>It is difficult for us in England to understand how far-reaching
may be the evils, resulting from the complete
failure of the rainfall, in countries where the population
relies upon it for their daily bread. A brief mention, in the
Press, of the lateness of the monsoon gives no sign of the
anxiety with which many millions of people are regarding
the approaching harvest. Water means life to the rice-fields,
and a drought implies, not alone the failure of a
staple crop, but famine, with disorder and starvation,
disease and death, as its accompaniments. A drought in
the rice-fields makes a holocaust of the people in the winter.
The forces of law and order at the disposal of the Government
of India place some restraint upon the populace. In
the Far East, where the civil administration is incompetent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
to deal with the exigencies of the situation, and the
systematic dispensation of relief is unknown, the decimation
of the population and the complete upheaval of the
social fabric follows closely upon the break-down in nature.
Indirectly, too, the consequences of famine in India prove
this.</p>

<p>An even more emphatic evidence of the effects of a
drought, where the population live upon the rice crop, is
afforded by the appalling loss of life and the grave eruption
of disorder, which took place in Korea as the consequence
of the famine in 1901. Widespread ruin overtook
the country; the inland districts were thronged with mobs
of desperate people. Persons, normally peace-loving and
law-abiding, banded together to harass the country-side, in
the hope of extorting sufficient food to keep their families
and themselves from starvation. Hunger drove whole communities
from the villages to the towns, where no provision
for their welfare existed. Anarchy prevailed throughout
the country, the dire needs of the population goading them
to desperation. A horde of beggars invaded the capital.
Deeds of violence made the streets of Seoul unsafe after
darkness, and bandits carried on their depredations openly
in the Metropolitan Province. From a peaceful and happy
land of sunshine and repose, Korea was transformed, in a
few months, into a wilderness of misery, poverty, and
unrest.</p>

<p>The measures for relief were quite inadequate, and
although rice was imported, large numbers of the people,
lacking the money with which to buy it, starved to death.
The absence of an efficient organisation in the face of
this further disaster increased the confusion. Before
any arrangements could be made for their relief, several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
thousands had died. More than 20,000 destitute people were
discovered in Seoul, out of a population of rather less than
200,000. Reports from the provincial centres disclosed a
relapse into a state of absolute savagery in many rural
districts. Famine, pestilence, and death stalked abroad in
Korea for months, and many, who escaped starvation, lost
their lives subsequently in the great wave of disease which
swept over the land.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus68" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus68.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE TEMPLE OF HEAVEN, SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is impossible to believe that the famine would have
assumed its late proportions had the Government of Korea
maintained its embargo against the exportation of cereals
from the country. There can be no doubt that the withdrawal
of this prohibition contributed to the scarceness of
the food-stuffs which were procurable by the people, when
their straits were most severe. Mortality returns from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
areas devastated by the famine prove that the welfare of
more than one million persons was affected. The action of
Japan, therefore, in insisting upon the suspension of the
prohibition in order that the interests of some half-dozen
Japanese rice merchants might not suffer, deserves the
utmost condemnation. The primary responsibility for
this great loss of life rests entirely with the Japanese
Government. In terrorising the Government of Korea
into an act, the consequences of which brought death to
one million people, the Japanese Government committed
themselves to a policy which traversed alike the dictates of
reason and common sense, and outraged every principle of
humanity. The impartial observer must hold Korea guiltless
in this matter. It is, indeed, deplorable that the
vehement opposition of the Korean Government was not
respected. Nevertheless, the incident is valuable, as an
illustration of the objectionable attitude which distinguishes
the Government of Japan in its relations with Korea.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the drought the inhabitants of Seoul
believed that the Rain God was incensed. The Emperor
and his Court offered expiatory sacrifices upon three occasions.
As the rains were still withheld a period of penance
was proclaimed, in which prayers and fastings were ordained,
the populace ceasing from every form of labour and
relapsing into a condition of supreme idleness. Unhappily,
while the great mass of the people refrained from work, the
Emperor continued to employ many hundreds of labourers
upon the construction of the new Palace buildings. This
proceeding was held by the superstitious subjects of His
Majesty to account for the singular inclemency of the Rain
Demon, and some anxiety was felt in the capital lest the
usual calm of the city should be broken by riots. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
horrors were spared to Seoul, however, by the fortuitous
visitation of a passing shower. Men and women resumed
their toil, rejoicing in the belief that the evil influences had
been overcome. It was, however, but a brief respite only
that was granted. In a short time the drought prevailed
throughout the land, drying up the rice-fields, scorching
the pastures, and withering the crops. Under this baneful
visitation, the circumstances of the people became very
straitened. Hundreds were reduced to feeding off the
wild roots and grass of the wayside, and isolated cases of
cannibalism were reported.</p>

<p>The exceptional character of the drought lends interest
to the hydrometrical records for Chemulpo from 1887 to
the middle of 1901, which were forwarded to the bureau
by the correspondent of the Physical Observatory, St.
Petersburg. The rain-fall given is for the years 1887 to
1900, inclusive, and the first half of 1901; the snow-fall is
reduced to the proportion of water which the melted snow
would make. Professor H. Hulbert has pointed out, however,
that in estimating what is or what is not a proper
amount of rain, it is necessary to know in what season of
the year the rain has fallen. Thirty inches of rain in
November would be of less value to the rice-fields than
half that amount if it fell in June. In the cultivation of
rice, rain must fall at the proper time. Otherwise it is
valueless, and, although adding to the actual measurement
of the fall, a very considerable deluge, under these conditions,
would be of no material advantage to agricultural
interests.</p>

<p>In a rice-growing country such as this is, it is essential
that an adequate supply of rain should fall during the three
summer months to allow of the seed-rice being transplanted
and to ensure the maturing of the grain. In
1901, owing to the lack of water, the bulk of the seed-rice
was never transplanted at all. It simply withered away.</p>

<p>It is, of course, inevitable that one of the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
results of famine should be a general increase of mortality
throughout the country. The impoverished condition, to
which so many thousands of Koreans were reduced,
weakened their constitutions so seriously that, in many
cases, even those who were fortunate enough to escape
starvation found their powers fatally impaired. There were
many whose inanition and general debility, resulting from
their deprivations, had rendered them peculiarly susceptible
to disease. More particularly was this the case in the inland
districts.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, malaria is, perhaps, the most
common disease in Korea. It prevails in all parts of the
country, but it is specifically localised in sections where
there are numerous rice-fields. Small-pox is nearly always
present, breaking out in epidemic form every few years.
Nearly all adults, and most children over ten years, will
be found to have had it. Leprosy is fairly prevalent in the
southern provinces, but it spreads very slowly. While this
disease presents all the characteristics described in the
text-books, the almost imperceptible increase, which distinguishes
its existence in Korea, is strong presumptive
evidence that it is non-infectious.</p>

<p>The great enemy of health is the tubercle bacillus. The
want of ventilation, the absence of sanitation, and the
smallness of the houses, foster this little germ. Tubercular
and joint diseases are common; also fistula, hare-lip, diseases
of the eye, throat and ear. The most common disease
of the eye is cataract; of the ear, suppuration of the middle
drum, in the great majority of cases the result of small-pox
in childhood. Cases of nasal polypi are also very numerous.
Hysteria is fairly common, while epilepsy and paralysis are
among other nervous disorders which are encountered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Indigestion is almost a national curse, the habit of eating
rapidly large quantities of boiled rice and raw fish promoting
this scourge. Toothache is less frequent than in
other countries; diphtheria and typhoid are very rare, and
scarlet fever scarcely exists. Typhus, malarial remittent
fever, and relapsing fever are not uncommon. Venereal
disease is about as general as it used to be in England.</p>

<p>In short, there is a preponderance of diseases which
result from filthy habits, as also of those produced by the
indifferent qualities of the food, and the small and over-crowded
houses. Most of the diseases common to
humanity present themselves for treatment in Korea.</p>

<p>The missionary question—Ethics of Christianity—Cant and
commerce—The necessity for restraint</p>

</div>

<p>The history of missionary enterprise in Korea abounds in
illustrations of the remarkable manner in which French
missionaries may be relied upon to offer up their lives
for their country. It may be cynical to say so, yet there
is much reason to believe that the Roman Catholic priests
in the Far East of to-day are the <i>agents provocateurs</i> of their
Government. They promote anarchy and outrage, even
encompassing their own deaths, whenever the interests of
their country demand it. From the beginnings of Christianity
in China they have wooed the glory of martyrdom,
and they have repeated the process in Korea.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus70" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus70.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A BRIDGE SCENE IN SEOUL</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Christianity made its way into Korea about 1777, by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
chance arrival of a packet of translations in Chinese of the
works of the Jesuits in Pekin. From this small beginning
the ideas spread, until the King’s Preceptor was compelled
to fulminate a public document against this new belief.
Finding this insufficient, examples were made of prominent
enthusiasts. Many were tortured; and others condemned
to perpetual exile. Persecution continued until 1787; but
the work of proselytism proceeded, despite the injurious
attentions which converts received from the public
executioners.</p>

<p>The first attempt of a foreign missionary to enter Korea
was made in 1791. It was not until three years later, however,
that any Western evangelist succeeded in evading the
vigilance of the border sentinels. Where one came others
naturally followed, undeterred by the violent deaths which
so many of these intrepid Christians had suffered. While
the French missionaries were prosecuting their perilous
labours, in the face of the undisguised hostility of the great
proportion of the people, and losing their lives as the price
of this work, the walls of isolation which Korea had built
around herself were gradually sapped. Ships from France,
Russia and Great Britain touched her shores during their
explorations and trading ventures in the Yellow Sea. Under
the association of ideas which sprang from the appearance
of these strange ships, the Koreans grew accustomed to the
notion that their world was not limited by the resources of
their own country and the more distant territories of China.
However, judging the sailors who fell into their hands by
the standards of the French priests, who had set every law
in the land at defiance, they at once killed them. This
practice continued until 1866, when word reached the
Admiral of a French squadron at Tientsin of the slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
of his compatriots in Korea. Upon receipt of the news, an
expedition was prepared, of itself an early manifestation of
that policy by which the French Government is inspired
in its dealings with missionaries and missionary questions
in countries, the development of whose geographical or
industrial peculiarities may be turned to advantage.</p>

<p>For many centuries the land was without any accepted
religious doctrine. Buddhism, which existed for one
thousand years before the present dynasty came to the
throne, had fallen into disfavour; the tenets of Confucius
did not completely satisfy the minds of the upper classes,
and Shamanism was the worship of the more primitive
masses. The moment was ripe for the introduction of a
more practical philosophy, and in time, as the gospel of
Christianity spread, opposition to the great creed of humanitarianism
lessened. Toleration of the many phases of
Western belief is now general, the Korean finding in the
profession of Christianity an easy means of evading the
exactions of the officials. Nevertheless, the diffusion of
Christianity is not unattended with bloodshed and disaster.
Apart from this drawback to the propagation of Christian
beliefs in Korea, it may be doubted whether the methods of
the various missionary bodies bear the impress of that spirit
of charity which should illustrate their teaching. Without
impugning the individual attainments of any of the many
missionary groups who administer to the needs of the
Koreans, I find it difficult to affirm that the principles of
self-abnegation so manifest in the lives of the Roman
Catholic priests and the workers of the Church of England
Mission, are equally in evidence in the comfortable existence
which is led by the well-paid <i>attachés</i> of the American
Mission Boards. The French priests live in abject poverty;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
striving to identify themselves with the conditions of their
flock, they accept neither holiday nor reward as compensation
for their services. In this bare comparison of the
principles of ministration, I do not wish, at the moment, to
venture into the domain of controversy, but merely to
convey some impression of the competing systems of
procedure.</p>

<p>The Church of England Mission, which has become
known as the English Mission, under the direction of
Bishop Corfe has adopted a system of communism.
The expenses of board, lodging, clothing, laundry
and fuel are met from a common fund, quarterly remitted
from the Mission Treasurer to the responsible head
of each Mission House. In proportion to the number of
residents, the expenditure is returnable upon a <i>pro rata</i>
calculation of about £70 per head per annum. This
estimate includes the cost of the male staff. The proportionate
rate of expenditure in respect of the lady
workers of the English Mission is one-third of this
annual disbursement less. The <i>depôts</i> of the Mission are
situated at Seoul, Chemulpo, Mok-po, and Kang-wha; in
addition to the stations in Korea, a chaplaincy is maintained
in New-chwang. The chief centre of activity of this
Mission is upon the island of Kang-wha. The task of improving
the condition of the very poor, by means of education,
kindness and patience, proceeds quietly at Chemulpo
and Seoul too, where particular attention is given to the
welfare of the sick. At one time, there were important dispensary
and hospital institutes in these places, the medical
establishment at Chemulpo, however, is now abandoned.</p>

<p>The members of this Mission endure no little privation
in the primitive simplicity of their surroundings. Their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
services, on the other hand, display much unnecessary
pomp; and the white, full-skirted cassock with rough
hempen girdle, which they wear in public and private,
emphasises their ritualistic tendencies, and is, to my mind,
somewhat of an affectation. Nevertheless, in their daily
practice, those associated with the Church of England
Mission in Korea set before themselves that standard of
idealism in missionary enterprise which is represented by
the unnecessary sacrifices, the sublime heroism, and fortitude
distinguishing the priests of the Roman Catholic
Church, a standard, I am compelled to admit, that other
missions in the Far East—American, English, Scotch, and
Irish—appear incapable of realising.</p>

<p>The American missionary in the Far East is a curious
creature. He represents a union of devices which have
made him a factor of considerable commercial importance.
American missionaries in Korea were formerly closely associated
with the more important export houses in the leading
industrial centres of America. Owing to diplomatic representation
this practical demonstration of Western superiority
is no longer openly indulged. In Seoul, however,
an American missionary inconsiderately receives paying
guests, causing a manifest loss of business to the Station
Hotel; in Won-san, another exploits his orchard. As a class
they are necessarily newspaper correspondents and professional
photographers; upon rare occasions—and here I refer
especially to a small coterie of American missionaries in
Seoul—they are the scholarly students of the history,
manners, customs and language of the country in which
they happen to be placed.</p>

<p>The American missionary has a salary which frequently exceeds
£200 a year, and is invariably pleasantly supplemented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
by additional allowances. Houses and servants are provided
free, or grants are made for house rent; there is a
provision for the education of the children, and an annual
capitation payment is made for each child. As a class,
American missionaries have large families, who live in comparative
idleness and luxury. In Korea, they own the most
attractive and commodious houses in the foreign settlements,
and appear to me to extract from their surroundings
the maximum of profit for the minimum of labour. I do
not know whether it is with the permission of the executive
officers of the American Mission Boards that their representatives
combine commerce with their mission to the heathen.
When a missionary devotes no little portion of his time to
literary labours, to the care of an insurance agency, to the
needs of a fruit farm, or to the manifold exigencies of casual
commerce, it seems to me that the interests of those who sit
in darkness must suffer.</p>

<p>American mission agents have made Korea their peculiar
field. Converts, who prattle of Christianity in a marked
American accent, are among the features of the capital in
the twentieth century. Mission centres, which have been
created in a number of places, now show signs of prosperity.
They enlist no little practical sympathy and support from
the native population. The self-supporting character of
much of the missionary work in Korea bears out the spirit
of toleration which distinguishes the attitude of the people
towards the propaganda. It is not to be supposed that the
work of the missionaries is agreeable to all shades of native
opinion. Riots and bloodshed disfigure the path of proselytism,
the credulity of the natives entailing heavy sacrifices of
life. The disturbances which have thus marked the spread of
Christianity in Korea, notably in the anti-Christian rising in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
Quelpart, a few months ago, are due to the jealousy with
which the heathen mass of the population regard the protection
from official rapacity, enjoyed by those who accept
The Light.</p>

<p>In the case of Quelpart, this feeling of animosity, and
the immunity from taxation which the French priests gave
to their following, created an intolerable position. Anarchy
swept over the island, and some six hundred believers were
put summarily to death. Whatever may be the compensating
advantages of this martyrdom, the reckless and profligate
sacrifice of life, which missionary indiscretion in the Far
East has promoted, is an outrage upon modern civilisation.
We have passed through one terrible anti-Christian upheaval
in China, and, if we wish to avoid another such manifestation,
it is necessary to superintend all forms of missionary
enterprise more closely. This, however, can be done only
by legislative supervision, imposing restraint in the direction
which recent events have indicated. It is imperative that
certain measures should be adopted in missionary work
which will ensure the safety of the individual zealot, and be
agreeable to the general comfort of the community. It is
unfortunate, but inevitable, that such reforms must be
radical. The violence of missionary enterprise during
recent years has been altogether unbridled. The great
activity of the different societies, resulting from their unrestricted
liberty, has recoiled most fatally upon the more
indefatigable, as well as upon the heads of many wholly
innocent of any unwarrantable religious persecution. The
time has come, therefore, when vigorous restrictions should
chasten this vigorous, polemical proselytism. The practice
of scattering missionaries broadcast over the interior of
these Far Eastern countries should not continue; the assent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
of the local Consul and a representative council of the
Foreign Ministers should be required in every case. Moreover,
it would be wiser, if, under no conceivable circumstances,
single women were permitted to proselytise beyond
the carefully prescribed treaty limits of the different
settlements. Again, missionaries with families, as well as
single women, should not be allowed to live beyond the
areas of these neutral zones.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus71" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus71.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE STREETS ARE MAGNIFICENT</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These restraints upon missionary labours will, of course,
be resented. If the total number of lives which have been
lost in Korea, China, and Japan, by the interference of
Western missionaries, were published, their vast aggregate
would reveal to the unthinking masses of the public how
urgent is the need for strong action. Such restraint is
morally justifiable by the appalling massacres with which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
the world is now familiar. The blind perseverance of the
missionary has frequently brought about the simultaneous
baptism and crucifixion of the convert. What more does
the fanatical enthusiast wish than that some one should be
thus doubly glorified by his means? The increasing death-roll
among masters and pupils supplies the only necessary
argument for immediate rectification of the entire system of
missionary enterprise.</p>

Han River, frolic and leisure</p>

</div>

<p>Travelling in the inland regions of Korea is not the
most comfortable pastime which can be devised, although it
has many attractions. The lively bustle of the roads
gradually gives place to the passing panorama of the
scenery, which presents in constant variation a landscape
of much natural beauty, with hills and meadows, bush-clad
mountains and rice-fields, rivers, lakes, and raging torrents
as prominent features. The shifting camp soon leaves the
outposts of civilisation behind. This slow passing into the
wilderness gives a subtle charm to the journey. Each turn
of the track emphasises the desolation of the ever-changing
scene. The wide expanse of plains and valleys makes way
for the depths of wild and gloomy forests, where the ragged
mountain-paths are slippery and dangerous. The ozone of
a new life pervades the air. There is no doubt that such
moments seem, for the time, the most perfect existence
imaginable. Freedom is untrammelled by a care; the world
for the day is comprised within a space as great as can be
seen. Upon the morrow, its limitation is only a little more
remote. The birds of the air, the beasts of the field, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
game in the bushes, supply the provender of the camp.
Villages provide rice, vegetables and eggs, the hillside
springs give water, the rivers permit bathing. The air is
pure, and the whole aspect of life is beautiful and joyous.</p>

<p>At the end of a trying day, one, perhaps, marred by an
accident to an animal, trouble with the native servants, rain,
fog, or the difficulties of the track, there is the evening
camp. Those hours of rest and idleness, when the horses
are fed and groomed, the packs unswung, the camp-beds
slung beneath the mosquito curtains, and the evening meal
prepared, are full of a supreme sensation of contentment.
I have always loved these moments of peace, accepting
what they brought as the best that life held for me at the
time. At such an hour the refinements of civilisation and
the restrictions of convention seem puerile enough. Moreover,
there is much material benefit to be derived from
such an undertaking. The trials and difficulties develop
stability of character; the risks and dangers promote
resource and self-reliance. There is much to be learnt
from this contact with a human nature differing so radically
from the prescribed types and patterns of the Western
standard. There is something new in every phase of the
experience. If it be only an impression, such as I have
endeavoured to trace in these few lines, it is one which
lingers in the mind long after other memories have faded.</p>

<p>Preparation for an inland journey of any extent takes a
considerable time; ponies have to be hired, servants engaged,
and interpreters secured. It is as well to personally
examine the pack ponies which are to carry the loads.
Koreans treat their animals shamefully, and the missionaries
make no efforts to lighten the lot of these unhappy
beasts. In consequence of the carelessness with which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
ponies are treated by their Korean masters, the poor little
brutes suffer from back-sores larger and more dreadful than
anything I have seen in any other part of the globe. If the
Koreans could be taught the rudiments of horse-mastering
and a more humane principle of loading and packing their
rough saddles, as well as some practical veterinary knowledge,
the lot of the unlucky little pony of the capital might
be softened. But the spectacle of broken knees, raw necks,
bleeding backs, and sore heels which these poor animals
present, as they pass in quick succession along the streets
of Seoul, is revolting. The American missionaries boast so
much of their good deeds that it seems strange that they
should neglect such a crying evil as this. There is, I
presume, no credit to be “gotten” from alleviating the
sufferings of a mere, broken-down, Korean pack pony.</p>

<p>Large numbers of the pack ponies of Korea come from
Quelpart. They are diminutive in size, little larger than the
Shetland breed, and rather smaller than the Welsh pony.
They are usually stallions, given to fighting and kicking
amongst themselves, and reputed savage. Their wildness is
aggravated through a daily irritation by the rough surfaces
of their pack saddles of the inflamed swellings on their
backs. They endure longer marches and shorter food
allowances than almost any other species of horse; they are
quick in their gait, very strong, and willing, good feeders,
and reveal extraordinary obstinacy, tenacity, and patience.
Much of the pleasure in my travels in Korea, however, was
entirely spoilt by the abominable neglect with which the native
grooms treated their charges. Their dreadful condition
goaded one to fury, and almost daily I remonstrated with one
or other of the grooms for gross cruelty. My remarks had
not the smallest effect, however, save that they wore me out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
and in the end I abandoned my expeditions to avoid the
horrors of such spectacles. The Korean is quite callous to
the sufferings of his animals. He will feed them well, and he
will willingly disturb himself at night to prepare their food;
but he will not allow ulcerated and running wounds to interfere
with the daily work of the poor beasts. This is comprehensible;
but he will not, upon his own initiative, even
endeavour to bridge the sore by the tricky placing of a pad.
However bad the gathering may be, on goes the load, the
agony of the poor pony manifesting itself in a flourish of
kicks, bites, and squeals.</p>

<p>In demonstration of this extreme callousness I may
mention this incident. Once, outside Won-san, I saw a
Korean seat himself upon the side of a stone, and leisurely
proceed to rain blows upon the head of a dog which he was
holding, until the poor thing collapsed insensible. He
then beat it about the ribs, and put the body on the embers
of a fire. We were several hundred yards off when
this attracted my notice; but I chased the brute across
two paddy stretches, until the heavy going compelled me to
abandon it. At a later time I noticed that the grooms were
most careful to dress the backs of the horses at our
different halts, and also to endeavour to prevent the pack
saddles from rubbing the wounds, prompted, I have no
doubt, to this most desirable kindliness by the lesson which
they had read between the lines upon the occasion of the dog
incident.</p>

<p>The character of the native followers who accompany
these journeys is a matter of great importance to the future
welfare of the traveller. The proprietor of the Station
Hotel, Seoul, secured me an excellent boy. Shortly after
entering my service, an American missionary, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
hankering after the lad for some time before he was brought
to me, suborned him. He deserted me upon the eve of my
second expedition. This trick is seldom perpetrated
east of Suez between Europeans with native servants; it is
one of the few unwritten laws of the East and observed
everywhere. I reported the matter to the American
Minister, Dr. Allen, but the missionary kept the boy.
Servants, grooms, and a coolie of a sort, are all necessary
upon these expeditions; one groom to each horse is a
wise allowance. Koreans like to send three horses to two
men; however, my division is the better. Europeans require
a body-servant, who will look after the personal effects
of his master, and wait at table. An interpreter, who can
speak Chinese and some European language, either German,
French, or English, is invaluable. It is safer in each case
to take men who are not converts. A coolie is useful and
gives a little variety to the beasts of burden; he carries the
camera, water-bottles, and small impedimenta of the hour.
A <i>chef</i> is not really necessary—my interpreter voluntarily
served as cook. The interpreter in any journey inland
should be mounted; it saves considerable friction if the
personal servants be allowed to ride on the baggage ponies.
Interpreters receive from thirty to forty dollars a month;
personal servants from eight to twenty dollars a month;
coolies from eight to ten dollars a month. The hire for the
horses, with whom the grooms are included, is a dollar a
day, half the amount paid down in advance upon the day of
starting. All calculations are made in Korean currency.
The entire staff, except the horses and grooms, is fed by the
traveller. The interpreter takes charge of the accounts.
He will, if ordered, take down the Chinese and Korean names
of the villages, streams, lakes, valleys, plains, mountains and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
roads which are passed. This is useful; the map of Korea
is most hopelessly out of date, and by forwarding these
names to the Geographical Society some little good is
accomplished. The interpreter will pay the coolies, grooms,
and other servants in debased currency, and charge the
account in Mexican dollars, making a profit of seventy-five
per cent.; he is greedy and tenacious to the interests of his
pocket, and he will suggest that he requires a servant. For this
remark he should be flogged. He will muddle his accounts
whenever he can; he will lose receipts if he can find no
other way of squeezing. He is apparently an innocent,
transparently honest, and devoted to the principles of
sobriety and virtue—unless there is an opportunity to go the
usual path. Under every condition he should be watched.</p>

<p>The Korean does not approach the Chinaman as a body-servant;
he has neither initiative nor the capacity for the
work, while he combines intemperance, immorality, and
laziness in varying degrees. The master usually ends
by waiting upon his man. There is, however, an antidote
for this state of things. If sufficient point be put into the
argument, and the demonstration be further enforced by an
occasional kick, as circumstances may require, it is possible
to convert a first-class, sun-loving wastrel into a willing, if unintelligent,
servant. Under any conditions, his dishonesty
will be incorrigible.</p>

<p>It is never necessary to take any large stock of provisions
when travelling in Korea. Eggs, fowl, fresh fish, fruit,
matches, tobacco, vegetables, and crushed rice flour can be
procured at any village in large quantities. The inhabitants
will perhaps declare that there are no such things in the
village; that they are miserably poor. The village usually
bears the stamp of its condition pretty plainly, and I found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
that where this occurred the most effectual remedy was to
call up the oldest man visible, to offer him a cigarette, to
calm him down, and then to give the interpreter some
money and to send off the pair of them. Once this system
failed in a flea-infested hole on the west coast, where the
village inn had no stables, and I really thought there were
no fowls; of a sudden, as though satirising the expression
of regret of several villagers, two fowls fluttered over a wall
into the road. The meeting broke up in confusion. The
grooms, the servants and the interpreter at once tackled the
mob, laying about them with their whips; little damage was
done, but considerable commotion ensued, and stables, fowls
and eggs were at once forthcoming and as promptly paid for.
In regard to payments made to the villagers, it is as well to make
certain that the grooms pay for the horses’ accommodation;
if they can avoid it they will do so, and a memory of this
lingering in the mind of the inn-keeper, makes him shut his
doors when the next foreigner is passing. But, in a general
way, if everything is paid for, anything is procurable—even
crockery and charcoal stoves, at a pinch, when the difficulties
of the precipitous track have played unusual havoc
in the china basket.</p>

<p>In the routine of the march, it is pleasant to camp beyond
the village for the noonday halt; near the river, if the
weather permits bathing. The food can be prepared in the
sunlight under some trees. This picnic halt gives an agreeable
change from the native inn, over which the missionaries
wail perpetually; it is, indeed, always to be avoided. I was
several times in Korean inns, driven in by some sudden and
temporary downpour, which cut off my retreat. The evening
camp made me independent of them in general; every
evening the interpreter found the cleanest-looking private<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
house and bargained with its proprietor to let two rooms
for the time of my visit. The arrangement was never
refused, nor was I ever subjected to rudeness or to any insult
upon these occasions. The family would freely help my
servants, and when the grooms had removed themselves
and their horses to the inn stables, no one was disturbed.
The boy prepared breakfast in the morning. The space
allotted to us was always ample for my camp-bed, kit, and
mosquito curtains. It opened, as a rule, upon the courtyard,
around which the house is built. There was plenty of
air, as one side was open; the flooring was of thick timbers,
raised from the ground. If the weather proved inclement
the place afforded warmth and shelter. Moreover, this
system has much to commend it on the score of cleanliness;
the price paid by me, half a dollar, for the rooms was
of course usually double the price which had been arranged.
Occasionally while travelling, when these private houses
were unprocurable, other makeshifts had to be adopted, an
open encampment or the official quarters at the <i>Yamen</i>.
This latter place was inconvenient, and we always accepted
anything of a private nature rather than venture into the
<i>Yamen</i> or the inn. Many nights were passed upon the
verandahs of these houses, with a private room leading from
it at the back, in case it became necessary. Our beds were
pitched as much in the open as possible, the silent beauty of
the night hours quite justifying the measure. Many nights
I undressed upon the edge of the street, my camp-bed
pitched beneath a verandah, a peaceful and inoffensive
crowd of Koreans smoking and watching me a few feet off.
I would get into my sleeping-suit, roll into my camp-bed,
and close the mosquito curtains, upon which the crowd
would quietly disperse. As publicity was unavoidable, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
it was useless to object, it was easier to accept the situation
than to struggle with the curiosity of the spectators.</p>

<p>It is always well to dispense with everything which can
be discarded. A camp-bed well off the ground and more
strongly made than those of the usual American pattern, is
essential; a field kit canvas valise, the Wolseley pattern,
containing a pocket at either end, with a cork mattress, is
also indispensable. It will carry all personal effects.
Flannel shirts, towels, socks and the like, including a book
or two, writing materials, mackintosh sheets, mosquito
curtains, and insect-powder are all which need to be included.
Fresh mint is useful against fleas if thrown about
near the sleeping things in little heaps. It is an invaluable
remedy and usually effective, though, by the way, I found
the fleas and bugs in the houses of New York and
Philadelphia infinitely less amenable to such treatment
than any I came across in Korea during my stay there.
A camera, a colonial saddle, Zeiss glasses, a shot-gun, a
sporting-rifle, a revolver, a hunting-knife, and a large
vulcanite water-bottle are necessary. A supply of sparklets
is to be recommended; these articles, with a coil of rope,
balls of string, jam, cocoa, tea, sugar, alcohol, potted meats,
tinned fruits, and biscuits, enamelled ware eating and
cooking things, with a few toilet accessories, completed my
materials. It is good policy to take a small hamper of
wines and luxuries, in case the opportunity occurs of
extending hospitality to an official or some other travelling
European. They are very serviceable among the officials.
Native tobacco is light, mild, and easily smokable. I
carried a pouch of it invariably. Canvas valises of the
service type are better than any kind of a box. With this
arrangement there are no corners or sharp edges to hurt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
the horses, and as a load, too, they do not make such hard,
unyielding objects against the side of a horse as any leather,
tin, or wooden contrivance. My bed and field-kit just
balanced upon one pony; my provisions and servants’
baggage fitted another. There was one spare pony. The
interpreter and myself rode; the servants were mounted
upon the baggage animals, the coolie walked.</p>

<p>At one time, when I was travelling with a German
friend, our retinue was exceedingly numerous; we each
had our personal establishment and a combined staff for
the expedition. This, however, is not quite the way to
rough it. It was, moreover, comparatively expensive and
a bother, inasmuch that so large a cavalcade required no
little managing. There was, however, something luxurious
and enjoyable in that procession across Korea, although it is
not the plan to be adopted in general.</p>

<p>There was little further to be accomplished by me in
Korea. My journey overland had taken me from Fusan to
Seoul, and again from Seoul to Won-san, my examination
of the inland and coast centres of mining and industry was
concluded: the beauties of the Diamond Mountains, with
their Buddhist monasteries, had been studied. At the end
of these labours, I was weary and ill at ease; moreover the
time was approaching when my long journey overland
from Seoul, the ancient capital of Korea, to Vladivostock,
the seat of Russian authority upon the Pacific coast, would
have to be begun. The heat in Seoul had been most
oppressive, when one day Mr. Gubbins, the British Minister,
suggested a short spell of rest and recuperation upon an
island a few miles up the Han River. Before nightfall, my
staff and I were floating, with the turn of the tide, up
the estuary of the river. Sea breezes blew over the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
expanse of the smoothly gliding waters, and the burden of
weariness which had been depressing me, lightened under
the influence of these gusty winds and the freshening air
from the harbour. The change from the hot and stuffy
surroundings of the capital, where the crowds had ceased to
be attractive and domestic bothers, arising from the preparation
for my Vladivostock journey, had begun to jar
upon the nerves, was most entrancing. When the moon
burst out from behind a blackened canopy of cloud, as we
sailed easily against the rapid current of the river, the
rugged outline of the cliffs across the waters proved the
reality of the transformation. During the small hours of
the night I lay awake, playing with the bubbles and froth of
the water in sweet contentment. I resolved to dally for a
few days upon the small islands in the stream, halting in
the heat of the sun and moving forward at night or in the
twilight, when sea-birds could be killed for the pot and fish
dragged from their cool depths for the breakfast dish. How
delightful were the plunges into that swift current; and
how often they were taken in the cool shade of some island
backwater! Care and anxiety dropped away in those days
of idle frolic, giving the mind, worn by the strain of many
months of travel and the hardships of two campaigns,
opportunity to recover its vigour. Then came some pleasant
weeks in the island monastery, where, from a Buddhist
haunt, perched high upon a lofty peak on Kang-wha, mile
upon mile of smiling scenery lay open to inspection from
my chamber window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BEYOND THE AMUR</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The salt water estuary of the Han is tempestuous and
deep, given over to much shipping and small craft. The
river itself does not begin for twenty miles above the tide-water
mouth, the intervening stretch of water belonging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
more correctly to the sea. Above Chemulpo, where the
full force of the Han current is hardly felt, the velocity
of the stream is quite five knots an hour. Where the
breadth of the river narrows the rapidity of the flow
increases. At a point, where the river makes a sudden
sweep round some overhanging bluffs, which confront each
other from opposite banks, the heavy volume of water thus
tumbling down becomes a swirling, boisterous mill-race, as
it twists and foams through its tortuous channels into
another tide-swollen reach. The place of meeting between
the sea and the river current shows itself in a line of choppy
water, neither rough nor smooth. The water is always
bubbling and always breaking at this point, in a manner
poetically suggestive of the spirits of the restless deep. The
Han river gives access to Seoul. In the days before the
railway, the choice of route to the capital lay between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
spending a night aground upon one of the many shifting
sand-banks in the river or the risks of a belated journey
overland, with pack ponies and the delights of a sand-bath
in the Little Sahara. There were many who found the “all
land” way preferable to the “land and water system,” to
which many groundings and much wading reduced the
experiment of travelling by junk or steam-launch in those
days. Now, however, the iron horse rules the road.</p>

<p>Kang-wha, brief history of the island—A monastic retreat, an
ideal rest—Nocturnal visitors—Midnight masses—Return to
the capital—Preparations for a great journey—Riots and
confusion</p>

</div>

<p>Kang-wha, the island to which I was sailing in these easy
stages, lies in the north-east quarter of the gulf, formed by
the right angle which the coast makes before taking that
northerly sweep which carries it, with a curve, to the mouth
of the Yalu River. On the south and south-west, Kang-wha
is exposed to the open sea; on the north, the island is
separated from the mainland by the Han estuary; and on
the east a narrow strait, scarce two hundred yards wide,
through which boats, journeying from Chemulpo to Seoul
must travel, severs the island from the mainland.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus74" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus74.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>WASHING CLOTHES IN A DRAIN</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span></p>

<p>The geographical features of the island include four
clearly-defined ranges of mountains, with peaks attaining
to an altitude of some two thousand feet. Broad and fertile
valleys, running from east to west, separate these ranges, the
agricultural industry of the population being conducted in
their open spaces. The villages and farmsteads, in which
the farming population dwell, are folded away in little
hollows along the sides of the valleys, securing shelter and
protection from the severity of the winter. Many hundred
acres of the flats, which form the approaches to these valleys
from the coast, have been reclaimed from the sea during
the last two centuries, the erection of sea dykes of considerable
length and immense strength having proceeded apace.
But for these heavy earthworks, what is now a flourishing
agricultural area would be nothing but a sea of mud washed
by every spring tide. The continuous encroachment of the
sea threatened at one time the extinction of all the low-lying
level land.</p>

<p>Kang-wha, with its curious monasteries and high protecting
battlements, now reduced to picturesque decay,
played a prominent part in the early history of Korea. It
has repelled invasion, and afforded sanctuary to the Royal
Family and the Government in days of trouble; the boldness
of its position has made it the first outpost to be
attacked and the most important to be defended. Twice in
the thirteenth century the capital was removed to Kang-wha
under stress of foreign invasion. With the exception of the
terrible Japanese invasion under Hideyoshi in 1592, and the
Chino-Japanese War in 1894-95, Kang-wha has felt the full
force of nearly every foreign expedition which has disturbed
the peace of the country during the past eight
centuries, notably those of the Mongols in the thirteenth, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
the Manchus in the seventeenth centuries, of the French in
1866, and of the Americans in 1871. Furthermore, Kang-wha
was the scene of the affair between Koreans and
Japanese which led to the conclusion of the first treaty
between Korea and Japan in 1876. The actual signing of
that instrument, the first of the series which has thrown
open Korea to the world, took place in Kang-wha city.
The predecessor of the present Emperor of Korea was born
in Kang-wha in 1831, living in retirement in the capital city
until he was called to the throne in 1849. Upon occasion,
Kang-wha has been deemed a suitable place of exile for
dethroned monarchs, inconvenient scions of Royalty, and
disgraced Ministers.</p>

<p>At two points in the narrow strait upon the east are
ferries to carry passengers to the mainland. Kang-song,
where the stream makes an abrupt turn between low cliffs,
is the scene of the American expedition of 1871; near the
southern entrance of the strait, and close to the ferry, are
the forts which repelled the American storming-party. The
famous rapids and whirlpool of Son-dol-mok, whose evil
reputation is the terror of the coast, are close by. There
are numerous forts dotted round the coast of the island, recalling
the Martello towers of Great Britain. They were
not all erected at one time; the majority of them date only
from the close of the seventeenth century, having been
raised in the early years of Suk-chong. The rampart upon
the eastern shore, which frowns down upon the straits and
river below, was erected in 1253. Ko-chong, of the Ko-ryö
dynasty, fled before the Mongol invasion of that date, removing
his Court and capital from Song-do to Kang-wha.
Kak-kot-chi, where there is a second ferry, is a few miles
beyond Kang-song. At the point where the ferry plies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
the hill of Mun-su rises twelve hundred feet high from
the water’s edge. From a junk a short distance from the
shore it appears to block the straits, so closely do the cliffs
of Kang-wha gather to the mainland. This little place
became the headquarters of the French expeditionary force
in 1866.</p>

<p>The capital of the island, Kang-wha city, is a battlemented
citadel, with walls fifteen <i>li</i> in circumference, and four
pavilioned city gates. It is a garrison town, beautiful in its
combination of green vistas and ancient, crumbling walls.
The Chino-Japanese War, so fatal to many of the old
institutions of Korea, diminished the ancient glory of
Kang-wha. For two hundred and sixty years prior to
this campaign, Kang-wha ranked with Song-do, Kang-chyu,
Syu-won and Chyön-chyön as one of the O-to, or Five
Citadels, upon which the safety of the Empire depended.
It controlled a garrison of ten thousand troops; the various
officials numbered nearly one thousand. The change in
the destiny of the kingdom brought a turn in the fortunes
of the island, and it is now administered by an official of
little importance. It is still, however, the seat of government
for a widely scattered region, and the centre of trade
and industry for some thirty thousand people. Agriculture
is the staple industry; stone-quarrying and mat-making are
other means by which the population exists. At the
water’s-side there are salt-pans; a certain amount of fishing,
a little pottery-making, smelting, the weaving of coarse
linen, to which work the wives of the farmers devote
themselves, complete the occupation of the inhabitants.
One pursuit, horse-breeding, for which Kang-wha was
once famous, is now completely abandoned.</p>

<p>There are nine monasteries under the government of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
the island. Seven are situated upon the island; the chief
of these is the fortified monastery of Chung-deung, the
Temple of Histories, the sometime pillar of defence of the
Kingdom, thirty <i>li</i> south of Kang-wha, famous as the scene
of the reverse suffered by the French troops in 1866.
Mun-su-sa, standing upon the mainland opposite, is included
in this little colony of Buddhistic retreats, as is
another, upon the island of Ma-eum-to, called Po-mun-sa,
famous for the wildness of its scenery and for a natural
rock temple in the side of the hill upon which it stands.
The monks of Chung-deung-sa enjoyed military rank until
quite recently. They were regarded as soldiers in times of
national distress; they received Government allowances,
food, and arms, in order to maintain them in a state of
efficiency. Buddhism has lost much of its hold upon the
islanders, although it existed before 1266. There is a
branch of the English Mission (Seoul) in Kang-wha, under
the administration of the Rev. Mark Napier Trollope, whose
notes upon this island were presented in a paper which their
author read before the local branch of the Royal Asiatic
Society during my stay in Korea. They materially assisted
me to collect the interesting data from which these few
paragraphs have been compiled.</p>

<p>I stayed five weeks in Kang-wha monastery, preparing
the skeleton of this present volume. Having gone there for a
week at the outside, I found the quiet and solitude of the
spot such a sanctuary from trouble, and such a panacea to
the nerves, that I was loath to abandon it. After a few days
in the cramped confinement of the native junk which had
conveyed me from Chemulpo, delaying much <i>en route</i>, it
was pleasant to stretch my limbs again upon the shore.
Landing one morning at daybreak, I fell upon the unsuspecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
guardian of the English Mission, Father Trollope,
and moved off at a later hour in the day across country to
the monastery. The monks were not at all disturbed by
my intrusion. Although strangers are not such frequent
visitors to this monastery as to those in the Diamond
Mountains, their presence excites no comment, and they
are allowed to go their way with that kindly indifference
to their existence which is, under the circumstances, the
height of courtesy. The Chief Abbot was informed of my
arrival, and, after a little explanation, ordered a very airy
building to be prepared for my reception. It was well
raised from the ground, and, situated just below the main
courtyard, afforded a magnificent view of the entire
domain. In the distance I could see the farm-lands of
the island and the sparkle of the sunlight upon the water;
more within the picture, and quite near to my new home,
were two wells, a running stream, and a stretch of mountain
slopes, cool, fragrant, and overgrown with scrub and
bush. Temples revealed themselves in a sea of foliage,
through which the drifting breezes played soft music. At
one end of this Hall of Entertainment were placed the
cooking and eating paraphernalia, in the middle my camp-bed,
and, overlooking the landscape, an improvised writing
table with my books and papers. There was no element of
unrest in the setting of my little camp. Every morning the
Chief Abbot welcomed me to the glories of another day; in
the evening we, through the medium of my interpreter,
talked together upon an amazing variety of subjects—Buddha
and Christ, this world and the next, Paris, London,
America. Duties in the monastery would prevent these
new friends from coming on certain nights; but they
always forewarned me of their absence, never disturbing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
me at my work, never taking me by surprise. The sense
of consideration and courtesy which their kindly hospitality
displayed was manifested in countless ways. The small
return which it was possible to make quite shamed me
before them. Frequently, at midnight, when my lights
were burning, the Abbot would walk across from his own
apartments and force me to bed with many smiles and
much gentle pressure, covering my manuscript with his
hands and nodding towards my camp-bed. There was no
screen to the front of my building, so it was always possible
for them to observe the stranger within their gates. This
inspection was most quietly carried on; indeed, if I turned
to the open courtyard, those who, perhaps, had been noting
the structure of my camp-bed, or the contents of my valise,
hanging to air upon a stout rope, flitted away like ghosts.
I was left, as I wished, in peaceful contemplation of my
work and the splendour of the scenery around me.</p>

<p>Catering arrangements were quite simple during my
stay in this monastery. Rice and eggs and fowls were
procurable from the villages beyond the walls of the
temple, and rice-flour or vegetables could be procured
from the butterman of the monastery. It was my plan to
take breakfast about ten o’clock in the morning, and to dine
about six o’clock in the evening. Between these hours was
my time for writing, and I was always fully occupied.
Before breakfast I walked abroad or prepared my notes of
the work for the day; after dinner I received my callers,
arranging anything of interest in my notes when they were
gone. Usually I witnessed the midnight gathering of the
monks, listening, with pleasure, to the booming of the
great bell of the monastery and the accompanying peals of
smaller bells of less melodious volume and much shriller
tone. The vibration in the air, as these wonderful noises
broke upon it, filled the high woods with melody and the
deep valleys with haunted strains as of spirit-music. After
the midnight mass, when the echoes had died away, the
delight of the moment was supreme. In utter weariness
and most absolute contentment I stretched myself to
slumber beneath the protecting draperies of the mosquito-curtains,
within the vaulted spaciousness of my Hall of
Entertainment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>Visitors to Chung-deung-sa were frequent during my
stay, some attracted by the reported presence of a foreigner,
others by their very genuine wish to sacrifice to the All-Blessed-One.
Two Korean ladies of position arrived in the
course of one morning to plead for the intercession of
Buddha in their burden of domestic misery and unhappiness.
Presenting the Korean equivalent for ten shillings to
the funds of the monastery, they arranged with the Abbot
for the celebration of a nocturnal mass in the Temple of
the Great Heroes. During the afternoon the priests prepared
the temple in which the celebration was to be held;
elaborate screens of Korean pictorial design were carried
into the temple from the cell of the Chief Abbot; large
quantities of the finest rice were boiled. High, conical
piles of sweetmeats and sacrificial cakes were placed in
large copper dishes before the main altar, where the three
figures of Buddha sat in their usual attitude of divine
meditation. In front of each figure stood a carved, gilded
tablet, twelve inches high, exactly opposite to which the
food was placed, with bowls of burning incense at intervals
between the dishes. Lighted candles, in long sticks, were
placed at either end of the altar; above it, in the centre,
serving as a lamp and hanging from a long gilded chain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
was suspended a bowl of white jade, in which lay the
smoking end of a lighted wick. Numerous side altars
were similarly decorated. The furniture of the temple
comprised a big drum, a heavy, cracked bell, cast in the
thirteenth century, and a pair of cymbals. There were
five monks; the two women sat, mute, upon the left of
the Abbot. The four priests arranged themselves upon
the right—one to the bell, one to the drum, and two to
the pair of cymbals, in the playing of which they took
turns. Upon each side of the temple, recessed right and
left of the main altar, were mural representations of the
Ten Judges. Save for the altar illuminations, the effect of
which was to render the interior even gloomier and more
eerie than usual, the building was in darkness.</p>

<p>The service began with the customary calling for
Buddha. The Abbot tapped upon a bamboo cane; every
one leant forward, their faces pressed down, and their
foreheads resting upon the floor. The palms of their
hands were extended beyond their heads in an attitude of
reverence and humility. This prostration was accompanied
by the intoning of a Thibetan chant, to the accompaniment
of a brass gong, struck with a horn handle by the Abbot
himself. Further prostrations followed upon the part of
the entire assemblage, the women joining in this part of
the service. For the most part they squatted silently and
reverently in their corner of the temple. As the different
services concluded the Abbot shifted the offerings before
the main altar to their appointed stations before the smaller
shrines, when the prayers proceeded afresh. Protracted
overtures were made to the picture of the Ten Judges,
before which the service apparently became fully choral.
One priest danced amazing and grotesque steps, strangely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
reminiscent of a Kaffir war-dance, the sole of one foot
striking the floor to the accompaniment of a clash of
cymbals as the other leapt into the air. Another priest
played upon the cracked bell, and a third kept up a dull,
monotonous thumping on the drum. The sole idea of the
priests, as conveyed to my mind by their celebration,
seemed to be the breaking up of the solemn silence of
the night by the most amazing medley of noises. At
intervals, in the course of the unmusical colloquy between
the drums, the cymbals, and the big bell, the monks
chanted their dirges, which were, in turn, punctuated by
the dislocated tapping of the Abbot’s brass bell and
wooden knocker.</p>

<p>It was deafening, the most penetrating discord of which
I have ever been the unfortunate auditor. With the conclusion
of the exercises upon the cymbals, which were
beaten together in a wide, circular sweep of the arms, then
tossed aloft, caught, and clanged together after the fashion
of the South African native with his spear and shield, the
performing priest returned to the companion who relieved
him. His more immediate activities over, he stood aside
laughing and talking with his colleagues in a voice which
quite drowned the chants in which his companions were
engaged. Then, panting with his late exertions, he proceeded
to fan himself with the most perfect unconcern,
finally examining the hem of his jacket for lice; his search
repaying him, he returned to his seat upon the floor and
lifted up his voice with the others. After the sacrifices and
prayers had been offered before the main altar and those
upon the right and left, extra tables of fruit, apples, dates,
nuts, cakes and incense, together with the previous dishes
of rice, cakes, incense and bread, were spread before a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
small shrine placed in front of the screen. Rice was piled
into a bowl, and, while the other monks were laughing and
chattering among themselves in the temple itself during the
progress of the sacrifice, the two women approached the
shrine and made obeisance three times, then touching each
dish with their fingers, bowed again and retired to their
corner. At the same time three priests, breaking from the
group that were talking by the doors of the building, sat
down in the centre of the temple upon their praying-mats,
seven or eight feet from the shrine. While one chanted
Korean prayers from a roll of paper, another struck and
rang the brass bell repeatedly, and the third hammered the
gong. Throughout this part of the service the others
chatted volubly, until they, too, joined in a chorus and
pæan of thanksgiving, breaking off from that to chant, in
low, suppressed tones, a not unimpressive litany.</p>

<p>Repetitions of the services I have described continued
all night. Sometimes there was more noise, sometimes less,
occasionally there was none, the tired, quavering voices of
the sleepy priests tremulously chanting the requisite number
of litanies. The women, who sat with wide-opened eyes,
watched with interest and were satisfied. The priests seemed
bored. Personally I was tired, dazed and stunned by the
uproar. During the progress of this strange service, I was
struck by the utter absence of that devotional fervour which
was so characteristic of the priests in the principal monasteries
of the Diamond Mountains.</p>

<p>The ceremony presently shifted from the Temple of the
Great Heroes to the spacious courtyard in front of it.
Here, when numerous fires had been lighted, the Abbot
and three priests, together with the two Korean women,
moved in procession. Their march was accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
the striking of many gongs and bells. The monks offered
prayers round heaps of pine branches, which had been
thrown together and lighted at the different spots. Chants
and prayers were repeated, and the same clashing of instruments
went on as before. It was not until a heavy rain
descended that the worshippers returned to the seclusion of
the temple. I felt, somehow, quite grateful to that shower of
rain. In the morning, my interpreter told me that this progress
in the courtyard formed a part of services which
accompanied the offering of special prayers for rain. It
would be a curious coincidence if this were so. Next day,
at the hour of my breakfast, there was some desire to
continue the celebration. My head was still aching with
the jarring discord of the bells, gongs, and cymbals of the
previous entertainment, and at the sight of the preparations
my appetite vanished. Breakfast became impossible; I
relinquished it to pray for peace. Happily this blessing
was granted me; and it was decided to hold no further
service—the rain, I presume, having appeared—and to
devour the sacrifices. All that day the monks and their
two guests ate the offerings. It was therefore a day of
undisturbed quiet, and as my prayer also had been granted,
each was satisfied, and we were a happy family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>My little holiday passed all too quickly. One day I
found myself preparing very sorrowfully to return to Seoul.
This accomplished, the news of my intended journey was
quickly bruited abroad by my servants. During these days
curio-dealers crowded the compound of the Station Hotel,
where, made very comfortable by the kindly forethought of
Mr. and Mrs. Emberley, I was still living. There is little
enough to buy in Seoul: quaint, brass cooking-utensils;
iron, inlaid with silver; tobacco boxes, jade cups, fans,
screens, and scrolls. My purchases were few; the native
furniture, massive presses, and cabinets faced with copper
plates, and small tea-tables, attracting me more than anything
else. The Emperor had already sent a present of
silk and fans to my hotel, and, with these few remaining
articles, my stock of Korean relics was completed. The
dealers were importunate, and crowded into the private
apartments of the hotel like bleating sheep into a pen.
Remonstrances were in vain, and I found the specific cure
for their pestiferous attentions to be administered best in
the shape of a little vigorous kicking. They took the cuffing
with much good humour, and retired to the courtyard,
where, at intervals in the day, a plaintive voice would be
heard calling upon His Highness to inspect the treasures
of his slave. His Highness, however, had concluded his
inspection.</p>

<p>The atmosphere in these hot days in Seoul was very
bad; the air was heavy with malodorous vapour; the days
were muggy and the nights damp. The steaming heat
of the capital emphasised the wisdom of an immediate
departure, and I hastened my exodus, touched up with a
little ague and a troublesome throat. The endless business
of obtaining servants, guides, and horses was repeated,
until at last the day of my removal was arranged and the
hour of actual departure fixed. The prospect was alluring—a
journey from Seoul to Vladivostock, through a wild and
desolate region, nearly eight hundred miles in length, lay
before me. Much of it was unexplored. It was the chance
of a lifetime, and, in thus embarking upon it, I was very
happy. My last farewells were said; my last calls had been
paid—the kindly hospitality of Seoul is not forgotten. The
day had come at last, the horses were pawing in the courtyard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
My effects, my guns, and camp-bed, my tent and
stores, were packed and roped. The horses had been
loaded; the hotel account had been settled, when my
interpreter quietly told me that my servants had struck for
ten dollars Mexican—one sovereign—monthly increase in
the wages of each. Mr. Emberley stood out against the
transaction; I offered to compound with half; they were
obdurate. It seemed to me that a crisis was impending.
I was too tired and too cross to remonstrate. I raised my
offer to eight dollars; it was refused—the servants were
dismissed. Uproar broke out in the courtyard, which
Mr. Emberley pacified by inducing the boys to accept my
last offer—a rise of eight dollars Mexican. My head-servant,
the brother of my interpreter, repudiated the
arrangement, but the significance of this increase had
assumed great importance. It was necessary to be firm.
I think now that it was unwise to have entertained any
change at all in the standard of payment. Upon the
question of the additional two dollars I stood firm; nothing
more would be given. The interpreter approached me to
intimate that if his brother did not go he also would stay
behind. I looked at him for a moment, at last understanding
the plot, and struck him. He ran into the courtyard
and yelled that he was dead—that he had been
murdered. The grooms in charge of the horses gathered
round him with loud cries of sympathy. Mr. Emberley
called them to him and explained the position of affairs. I
strode into the compound. The head groom came up to
me, demanding an increase of thirty dollars, Korean
currency, upon the terms which he had already accepted;
he wanted, further, three-quarters of the contract price to be
paid in advance; one quarter was the original stipulation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
I refused the thirty dollars, and thrashed him with my
whip.</p>

<p>The end of my journey for the moment had come, with
a vengeance. The head groom stormed and cursed and
ran raving in and out of the crowd. He then came for me
with a huge boulder, and, as I let out upon his temple, the
riot began. My baggage was thrown off the horses and
stones flew through the air. I hit and slashed at my
assailants and for a few minutes became the centre of a
very nasty situation. Servants and grooms, my interpreter,
and a few of the spectators went at it keenly while the fight
continued. In the end, Mr. Emberley cleared his courtyard
and recovered my kit; but I was cut a little upon the head
and my right hand showed a compound fracture—native
heads are bad things to hammer. Postponement was now
more than ever essential; my fears about my health were
realised. By nightfall upon the day of this outbreak signs
of sickness had developed; the pain had increased in my
hand and arm; my head was aching; my throat was inflamed.
I was advised to leave at once for Japan; upon
the next day I sailed, proposing to go to Yokohama and
thence to Vladivostock, starting the expedition from the
Russian fortress. However, by the time my steamer
arrived at Japan, I was in the clutch of enteric fever.
Further travel was out of the question, and when they
moved me from an hotel in Yokohama to a cabin upon
a Japanese steamer, which was to carry me to England,
in my mind I had bidden farewell to the countries of this
world, for the doctor told me that I was dying.</p>
